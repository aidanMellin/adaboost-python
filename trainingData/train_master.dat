en|in the Wearside League for Whitburn along with his brother Angus who would have a 
en|short professional career with Leicester After scoring over goals for Whitburn Jimmy had unsuccessful trials 
en|at South Shields and However Sunderland manager Bob Kyle decided to give Seed a second 
en|chance this time playing him at inside right instead of centre forward in a North 
en|Eastern League match against Wallsend Seed scored a hattrick in the match and was promptly 
en|signed by Sunderland as a professional in April Seed spent the season playing in Sunderland 
en|he scored plenty of goals as the team lifted the Durham Senior Cup Official League 
en|football was suspended at the end of that season because of the outbreak of World 
en|War I At the end of the season the Seed joined the Army Cyclist In 
en|the summer of he was drafted to France with the battalion of the West Yorkshire 
en|Seed suffered with depression after his arrival and in July he was gassed when a 
en|German aeroplane dropped mustard gas bombs on a house in Nieuwpoort Belgium in which he 
en|was He returned to England to convalesce and returned to France in August until being 
en|evacuated after being gassed in Valenciennes France two months With the cessation of hostilities Seed 
en|played a Victory League match for Sunderland against Durham City in however his lungs were 
en|weak and he had a poor On the strength of that performance the Sunderland directors 
en|decided that Seed's wartime experience had finished him as a footballer and gave him a 
en|free Seed never played an official first team game for Sunderland Seed was discharged from 
en|the army in March Seed's football career was rescued by Haydn Price former Wales international 
en|the manager of Welsh nonLeague team Mid Rhondda who were based in the town of 
en|Tonypandy Price offered Seed a chance to play for the South Wales club which was 
en|accepted and he signed for them in July Seed joined former England international Joe Bache 
en|and exteammate from Sunderland Frank Pattison in the MidRhondda side and they had a successful 
en|time in the seven months that Seed was with them winning both the Southern League 
en|Division Two and Welsh League Seed's good form attracted the attention of Tottenham Hotspur manager 
en|Peter McWilliam and in January he signed for the north London side for a fee 
en|of a move which caused some antagonism amongst supporters in After initially playing five games 
en|in the reserves Seed got his first team chance with Spurs making his debut at 
en|inside right and forming an immediate understanding with the legendary diminutive right winger Fanny Walden 
en|Seed played five games in the remainder of the season scoring two goals as Spurs 
en|ran away with the Division Two title Seed was a virtual ever present for Spurs 
en|in the following seven seasons in Division One The season saw Tottenham lift the FA 
en|Cup with Seed playing in all six matches in the cup run scoring five goals 
en|including a hat trick against Bradford City in the second round Just two months after 
en|getting his cup winners medal Seed was called up for the first of this five 
en|England caps on May against Belgium he never got a long run in the international 
en|side playing his final game in April saw Tottenham finish runners up to Liverpool in 
en|Division One with Seed scoring goals in appearances In February Peter McWilliam resigned as Spurs 
en|manager being replaced by Billy Minter Minter obviously thought the Seed was reaching the end 
en|of his career with a young Taffy O'Callaghan ready to take his place he promptly 
en|cut Seed's wages from to a week Seeds reaction to this was to ask to 
en|be released by the club at the end of the season and after looking like 
en|taking the playermanagers job at Aldershot he eventually signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a part 
en|exchange deal involving Darkie Lowdell and a cash adjustment paid by Seed made his Wednesday 
en|debut on August in the first match of the season against Everton During the first 
en|part of the season Seed was asked to play in numerous different positions by manager 
en|Bob Brown as Wednesday struggled in Division One By mid March they had won only 
en|six matches out of and were seven points adrift at the foot of the table 
en|At that stage Seed was made team captain with existing skipper Fred Keen being dropped 
en|Ellis Rimmer was bought from Tranmere Rovers and these changes triggered an amazing recovery Wednesday 
en|picked up points out of a possible in the last ten matches and avoided relegation 
en|by a point The irony was that it was Seed's old club Tottenham who were 
en|relegated on the final day of the season By his own admission Seed did not 
en|play his best football of his career at Wednesday but his experience and knowhow as 
en|captain was the catalyst that drove a young and talented Wednesday side to two successive 
en|Division One championships in the following two seasons and making this the most successful period 
en|in the club's He played in Sheffield Wednesday's defeat by Arsenal in the Charity Shield 
en|at Stamford Bridge in October Seed played four seasons at Hillsborough but by the season 
en|aged he was badly hampered by a knee injury and was often limping before the 
en|end of the games he often played even though he was not fully fit because 
en|of his talismanic influence on the team After damaging the ligaments in his right knee 
en|in a match against Newcastle United at Christmas he realised his playing days were numbered 
en|but he didn't retire until the end of the season He then took up an 
en|offer from Herbert Chapman to manage Clapton Orient which Chapman intended to become Arsenal's nursery 
en|He played for the "Professionals" in the FA Charity Seed began his managerial career at 
en|Clapton Orient He was tempted into the job by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman who told 
en|Seed that Arsenal had plans to buy Orient and turn them into a nursery club 
en|for Arsenal Seed commenced the job at a week but within a short time Arsenal 
en|were forced to abandon their plans after being told by the Football League that they 
en|were unlawful Without the financial backing of Arsenal Orient had very little money and the 
en|team struggled In Seed's first season as manager the team finished and then in the 
en|following campaign they avoided having to seek reelection on goal average In May he accepted 
en|the offer of the manager's job at Charlton Athletic despite Sheffield Wednesday trying to tempt 
en|Seed back to Hillsborough as a replacement for the manager Bob Brown Between and he 
en|led Charlton to successive promotions from the Third Division to the First Division In Charlton's 
en|first season in the topflight they finished runnersup behind Manchester City in They finished third 
en|and fourth in the final two seasons before the outbreak of the Second World War 
en|He led the team into a variety of regional competitions set up during the war 
en|and Charlton reached a Wembley final for the first time in They were beaten by 
en|Arsenal in the War Cup They were more successful in when captain Don Welsh lifted 
en|the trophy following a triumph over Chelsea They contested the first two postwar FA Cup 
en|finals at Wembley which were noted for the ball bursting on both occasions They were 
en|well beaten by Derby County in but a Chris Duffy goal beat Burnley in Despite 
en|the revenues generated by very large home attendances Charlton wouldn't allow Seed to invest in 
en|new players he 'discovered' Stanley Matthews but wasn't allowed to sign and so The Addicks 
en|were unable to repeat their prewar success in the First Division finishing no higher than 
en|ninth in the initial six seasons after the conflict They narrowly missed relegation in with 
en|a position finish but they finished fifth in Following two bottomhalfofthetable finishes Seed endured a 
en|dreadful start to the season losing their first five matches before being asked for his

en|mixed A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to 
en|one of its many messages that a few wellheeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping 
en|off their equally welloff patients Some pointed to a lack of balance between criticism and 
en|praise for hardworking doctors The majority accepted it for what it was a topical novel 
en|The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy 
en|while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book all overlooking the 
en|fact that it was a work of fiction not a scientific piece of research and 
en|not autobiographical In the United States The Citadel won the National Book Award Favorite Fiction 
en|of voted by members of the American Booksellers According to a Gallup poll conducted in 
en|The Citadel was voted the most interesting book readers had ever Some of Cronin's novels 
en|also deal with religion which he had grown away from during his medical training and 
en|career but to which he became reacquainted in the At medical school as he recounts 
en|in his autobiography he had become an agnostic "When I thought of God it was 
en|with a superior smile indicative of biological scorn for such an outworn myth" During his 
en|practice in Wales however the deep religious faith of the people he worked among made 
en|him start to wonder whether "the compass of existence held more than my textbooks had 
en|revealed more than I had ever dreamed of In short I lost my superiority and 
en|this though I was not then aware of it is the first step towards finding 
en|God" Cronin also came to feel that "If we consider the physical universe we cannot 
en|escape the notion of a primary Creator Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species 
en|its scientific doctrine of natural causes And still you are confronted with the same mystery 
en|primary and profound Ex nihilo nihil as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it 
en|nothing can come of nothing" This was brought home to him in London where in 
en|his spare time he had organised a working boys' club One day he invited a 
en|distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members The speaker adopting "a frankly atheistic 
en|approach" described the sequence of events leading to the emergence "though he did not say 
en|how" of the first primitive lifeform from lifeless matter When he concluded there was polite 
en|applause Then "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet" and with 
en|a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place The 
en|naïve question took everyone by surprise The lecturer "looked annoyed hesitated slowly turned red Then 
en|before he could answer the whole club burst into a howl of laughter The elaborate 
en|structure of logic offered by the testtube realist had been crumpled by one word of 
en|challenge from a simpleminded It was at university that Cronin met his future wife Agnes 
en|Mary Gibson May who was also a medical student She was the daughter of Robert 
en|Gibson a master baker and Agnes Thomson Gibson née Gilchrist of Hamilton Lanarkshire The couple 
en|married on August As a physician May worked with her husband briefly in the dispensary 
en|while he was employed by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society; she also assisted him with

en|first son Vincent was born in Tredegar in Their second son Patrick was born in 
en|London in Andrew their youngest son was born in London in With his stories being 
en|adapted for Hollywood films Cronin and his family moved to the United States in living 
en|in Bel Air California Nantucket Massachusetts Greenwich Connecticut and Blue Hill Maine In the Cronins 
en|sailed back to England aboard the RMS Queen Mary staying briefly in Hove and then 
en|in Raheny Ireland before returning to the US the following year They then took up 
en|residence at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City and then in Deerfield Massachusetts before 
en|settling in New Canaan Connecticut in Ever the nomad Cronin also travelled frequently to summer 
en|homes in Bermuda and Capd'Ail France Ultimately Cronin returned to Europe to reside in Lucerne 
en|and Montreux Switzerland for the last years of his life He continued to write into 
en|his eighties He included among his friends Laurence Olivier Charlie Chaplin and Audrey Hepburn to 
en|whose first son he was a godfather Although the latter part of his life was 
en|spent entirely abroad Cronin retained a great affection for the district of his childhood writing 
en|in to a local teacher "Although I have travelled the world over I must say 
en|in all sincerity that my heart belongs to Dumbarton In my study there is a 
en|beautiful coloured print of the Rock I even follow with great fervour the fortunes of 
en|the Dumbarton football Further evidence of Cronin's lifelong support of Dumbarton FC comes from a

en|first campus to Berkeley in The San Francisco and Los Angeles campuses followed in and 
en|respectively The original UCPD department at Berkeley was founded after World War II In September 
en|the Regents of the University of California established UCPD as a state lawenforcement agency The 
en|UCPD is one of several police agencies in California having a statewide jurisdiction and authority 
en|other examples include the California Highway Patrol the California State University Police Department and the 
en|California Department of Fish and Game UCPD officers like most California police officers are empowered 
en|by section of the California Penal Code giving them authority as duly sworn peace officers 
en|throughout the state of As specified by Section of the California Education Code their primary 
en|jurisdiction extends to the campuses and properties owned by the Regents of the University of 
en|California as well as lands within a onemile radius of those The department consists of 
en|ten departments one for each UC each led by its own chief of police Unlike 
en|other police departments in the state there is no single chief of the UCPD however 
en|one chief is selected as the department's central coordinator currently Chief David S Rose of 
en|UCSD The coordinator is responsible for compiling crime statistics from each campus as required by 
en|the Clery Act and for ensuring that the various departments are operating within the UCPD's 
en|mission However the coordinator does not dictate the daytoday operations of the department and each 
en|department sets its own Standard Operating Policies Still the UCPD is more coordinated than this

en|oriented policing The departments maintain communication with each other and frequently call upon each other 
en|for mutual aid which is facilitated by a department standard uniform and duty gear including

en|Saturn Devouring His Son is the name given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco 
en|Goya According to the traditional interpretation it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus 
en|in the title Romanized to Saturn who fearing that he would be overthrown by one 
en|of his ate each one upon their birth The work is one of the Black 
en|Paintings that Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between and It 
en|was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo 
en|del Prado in Madrid In Goya purchased a house on the banks of Manzanares near 
en|Madrid called Quinta del Sordo Villa of the Deaf Man It was a twostory house 
en|which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf although the name was 
en|fitting for Goya too who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in Between 
en|and when he left the house to move to Bordeaux Goya produced a series of 
en|works which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house At the 
en|age of and having survived two lifethreatening illnesses Goya was likely to have been concerned 
en|with his own mortality and was increasingly embittered by the civil strife occurring in Spain 
en|Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images in time 
en|he overpainted them all with the intensely haunting pictures known today as the Black Paintings 
en|Uncommissioned and never meant for public display these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some 
en|tense scenes of malevolence and Saturn Devouring His Son a portrait of the titan Saturn 
en|consuming one of his children was one of six works with which Goya decorated the 
en|dining room According to Roman myth inspired by the original Greek myth it had been 
en|foretold that one of the sons of Saturn would overthrow him just as he had 
en|overthrown his father Caelus To prevent this Saturn ate his children moments after each was 
en|born His wife Ops eventually hid his third son Jupiter on the island of Crete 
en|deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place Jupiter eventually supplanted 
en|his father just as the prophecy had predicted Goya never named the works he produced 
en|at Quinta del Sordo; the names were assigned by others after his and this painting 
en|is also known as just Saturn Saturn Devouring One of His Sons Saturn Devouring his 
en|Children or by the Spanish names Saturno devorando a su hijo or Saturno devorando a 
en|un hijo Goya depicts Saturn feasting upon one of his sons His child's head and 
en|part of the left arm have already been consumed The right arm has probably been 
en|eaten too though it could be folded in front of the body and held in 
en|place by Saturn's thumbs The titan is on the point of taking another bite from 
en|the left arm; as he looms from the darkness his mouth gapes and his eyes 
en|bulge widely The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh the 
en|red blood of the corpse and the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his 
en|fingers into the back of the body There is evidence that the picture may have 
en|originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect but if ever present this addition was 
en|lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to 
en|canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct It may even 
en|have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public Various interpretations of the 
en|meaning of the picture have been offered the conflict between youth and old age time 
en|as the devourer of all things the wrath of God and an allegory of the 
en|situation in Spain where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution There 
en|have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son Xavier the only of 
en|his six children to survive to adulthood or with his livein housekeeper and possible mistress 
en|Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed cannot be determined with certainty If 
en|Goya made any notes on the picture they have not survived; as he never intended 
en|the picture for public exhibition he probably had little interest in explaining its significance It 
en|has been said that the painting is "essential to our understanding of the human condition 
en|in modern times just as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is essential to understanding the tenor 
en|of the Goya may have been inspired by Peter Paul Rubens' picture of the same 
en|name Rubens' painting also held at the Museo del Prado is a brighter more conventional 
en|treatment of the myth his Saturn exhibits less of the cannibalistic ferocity portrayed in Goya's 
en|rendition However some critics have suggested that Rubens' portrayal is the more horrific the god 
en|is portrayed as a calculating remorseless killer who – fearing for his own position of 
en|power – murders his innocent child Goya's vision on the other hand shows a man driven 
en|mad by the act of killing his own son Or it could be interpreted as 
en|a titan driven wild with fear at the idea of usurpation from one of his 
en|children In addition the body of the son in Goya's picture is that of an 
en|adult not the helpless baby depicted by Rubens Goya had produced a chalk drawing of 
en|the same subject in that was closer in tone to Rubens' work it showed a 
en|Saturn similar in appearance to that of Rubens' daintily biting on the leg of one 
en|of his sons while he holds another like a leg of chicken with none of 
en|the gore or madness of the later work Goya scholar Fred Licht has raised doubts 
en|regarding the traditional title however noting that the classical iconographical attributes associated with Saturn are 
en|absent from the painting and the body of the smaller figure does not resemble that 
en|of an The rounded buttocks and wide hips of the headless corpse has also called 
en|into question the identification of this figure as a Although they were not meant to 
en|be seen by the public the paintings remain important works in Goya's oeuvre When Goya 
en|went into selfimposed exile in France in he passed Quinta del Sordo to his grandson 
en|Mariano After various changes of ownership the house came into the possession of the Belgian 
en|Baron Emile d'Erlanger in After years on the walls of Quinta del Sordo the murals 
en|were deteriorating badly and in order to preserve them the new owner of the house 
en|had them transferred to canvas under the direction of Salvador Martínez Cubells the chief art 
en|restorer at the Museo del Prado After showing them at the Exposition Universelle of in 
en|Paris d'Erlanger eventually donated them to the Spanish state The effects of time on the 
en|murals coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling 
en|plaster on canvas meant that most of the murals required restoration work and some detail 
en|may have been lost but in this respect Saturn Devouring His Son appears to have 
en|fared better than some of the other works In Saturn Devouring His Son became a 
en|popular Internet meme after photoshopped images of the painting surfaced online The figures depicted in 
en|the artwork have also been labelled frequently Saturn usually representing something the meme's creator finds

en|During the Cold War the two opposing forces in Europe were the Warsaw Pact countries 
en|on the one side and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO countries on the other 
en|side The Warsaw Pact was seen by the West as having an aggressive force outnumbering 
en|the NATO forces Soviet domination of the Warsaw Pact led to effective standardization on a 
en|few tank designs In comparison NATO adopted a defensive posture The major contributing nations France 
en|Germany the USA and the UK developed their own tank designs with little in common 
en|while the smaller nations of NATO purchased or adapted these designs After World War II 
en|tank development continued largely as it had been because of the Cold War Tanks would 
en|not only continue to be produced in huge numbers but the technology advanced dramatically as 
en|well Tanks became larger and their armour became thicker and much more effective Aspects of 
en|gun technology changed significantly as well with advances in shell design and terminal effectiveness However 
en|most contemporary tanks in service still have manually breechloaded guns a trait of the earliest 
en|tanks which is shared with most selfpropelled and field guns Many of the changes in 
en|tank design have been refinements to targeting and ranging fire control gun stabilisation communications and 
en|crew comfort Armour has evolved to keep pace with improvements in weaponry and guns have 
en|grown bigger But there have been no fundamental changes After World War II tank design 
en|budgets were cut and engineering staff was often scattered Many war plannerswho believed that with 
en|the advent of nuclear weapons the tank was obsolete given that a tactical nuclear weapon 
en|could destroy any brigade or regiment whether it was armoured or not The Korean War 
en|proved that tanks were still useful on the battlefield given the hesitation of the great 
en|powers to use nuclear weapons In the many nations' tanks were equipped with NBC protection 
en|allowing mechanized units to defend against nuclear biological and chemical weapons or to conduct breakthroughs 
en|by exploiting battlefield nuclear strikes Medium tanks gradually evolved into the new concept of the 
en|main battle tank This transition happened gradually in the as it was realized that medium 
en|tanks could carry guns such as the US gun Soviet tank gun and especially the 
en|British gun that could penetrate any practical level of armour at long range The World 
en|War II concept of heavy tanks armed with the most powerful guns and heaviest armour became 
en|obsolete since they were just as vulnerable as other vehicles to the new medium tankscitation 
en|needed Likewise World War II had shown that lightly armed lightly armoured tanks were of little 
en|value in most roles Even reconnaissance vehicles shown a trend towards heavier weight and greater 
en|firepower during World War II; speed was not a substitute for armor and firepower An increasing 
en|variety of antitank weapons and the perceived threat of a nuclear war prioritized the need 
en|for additional armor The additional armour prompted the design of even more powerful The main 
en|battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the 'Universal tank' 
en|filling almost all battlefield roles Typical main battle tanks were well armed and highly mobile 
en|but cheap enough to be built in large numbers The classic main battle tanks of 
en|the were the British Centurion the Soviet series and the US and series which saw 
en|continuous updates throughout the Cold war For example the Centurion began life with the highly 
en|effective gun but was upgraded to pounder and then main armament by with improved fire 
en|control and new engines The Russian started with a gun but has been upgraded with 
en|both and guns much improved fire control systems new engines track etc The series evolved 
en|through to the series The first Soviet main battle tank was the while the first 
en|American MBT was the These vehicles and their derivatives formed the bulk of the armoured 
en|forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War; many remain in use 
en|in the century Light tanks such as the Soviet maintained limited roles such as amphibious 
en|reconnaissance support of Airborne units and in rapid intervention forces which were not expected to 
en|face enemy tanks The US Sheridan had similar strengths and weaknesses but could also be 
en|airdropped either by parachute or LAPES The value of light tanks for scouting has been 
en|diminished greatly by helicopters although many continued to be fielded Heavy tanks such as the 
en|continued to be developed and fielded along with medium tanks until the and when the 
en|development of antitank guided missiles and powerful tank guns rendered them ineffective The combination of 
en|large HEAT warheads with a long effective range relative to a tank gun and with 
en|high accuracy meant that heavy tanks could no longer function in the standoff or overwatch 
en|role; much cheaper antitank guided missiles could fill this role just as well Medium tanks 
en|were just as vulnerable to the new missiles but could be fielded in greater numbers 
en|and had higher battlefield mobility After the Yom Kippur War of when Israeli tanks were 
en|destroyed in large quantities by manportable wire guided missiles ATGMs fired by Egyptian infantry concerns 
en|were raised on the vulnerability of tanks on the battlefield to antitank weapons Subsequent analysis 
en|showed that Israeli forces had underestimated their opponents during the first phases of the war; 
en|their alltank tactics ignored the newfound ability of Infantry armed with cheap AT weapons to 
en|stop tanks Tactically there was renewed recognition for the need for combinedarms tactics This led 
en|to greater mechanization of Infantry and advanced artillery tactics and warheads Tanks alone were vulnerable 
en|to Infantry but a combined team of tanks mechanized Infantry and mechanized artillery could still 
en|win in the new environment In the United States initiated a programme to modernise its 
en|existing tank fleet and start real mass production of the and later the at the 
en|same time the was developed Budgets for tank design and production picked up during the 
en|administration of president Ronald Reagan following tensions between the United States and the Soviet Unioncitation 
en|needed In response to infantryportable and vehiclemounted ATGMS ever more capable vehicle armour were developed 
en|Spaced armour composite explosive reactive armour and active protection systems—like the Russian Shtora Drozd and 
en|Arena—were added to old and new tanks Despite these improvements the larger missiles remained highly 
en|effective against tanks During the latter half of the century some tanks were armed with 
en|ATGMs AntiTank Guided Missiles which could be launched through a smoothbore or in the case 
en|of "Shillelagh" a rifled main gun barrel with a provision to prevent imparting "spin" to 
en|the missile In the US the Sheridan and prototype with barrellaunchers used the Shillelagh infraredguided 
en|missile The was cancelled prior to production due to high cost and superseded by the 
en|Abrams which used a conventional gun The and the were widely considered disappointing due to 
en|problems of overall complexity sensitive advanced electrical systems some components of which involved the Shillelagh 
en|guidance system and issues related to the conventional rounds with combustible cases though the Sheridan 
en|would serve into the before finally being withdrawn The were eventually replaced by using conventional

en|first US tanks to fight the North Korean The Chaffee fared poorly against these much 
en|betterarmed and armored medium tanks Chaffees were more successful later in the war in their 
en|reconnaissance role supported by heavier tanks such as the Sherman Pershing and Patton The heavier 
en|but older Pershing was deemed unsatisfactory due to its inferior mobility which was unsuitable for 
en|a medium tank role as it used the same engine that powered the much lighter 
en|Sherman and the upgraded received a new power plant and a main gun with bore 
en|evacuator and the Patton designation Less than a thousand were upgraded to standard On August 
en|the first Pattons landed in South Korea The tank proved superior to the much lighter 
en|North Korean which were encountered in relatively small numbers By the end of Pattons had 
en|been fielded forming about of US tank strength in Korea; the balance of tanks shipped 
en|to Korea during included Shermans Pershings and Chaffee light Subsequent shipments of and Pattons allowed 
en|all remaining Pershings to be withdrawn during and most Sherman equipped units were also By 
en|the Chaffees were completely replaced by the Walker Bulldog which was rushed to the battlefield 
en|by the US Army The Walker Bulldog saw limited combat during the Korean War but 
en|the conflict served as a testing ground to work out the deficiencies especially with its 
en|rangefinder British Centurion tanks assisted by Cromwells in the reconnaissance role arrived in Korea in 
en|late The UK tanks had to operate in much coldercitation needed conditions than their usual 
en|deployments on the North German Plain The Centurions covered the retreat at the battle of 
en|the Imjin River with the tanks from C Squadron Hussars under the command of Major 
en|Henry Huth and by Squadron Royal Engineers The British position on the Imjin river "was 
en|deemed safe" but vulnerable in case of an attack which prove to be and the 
en|tanks were able stand their ground in the battle The Centurions were also in Operation 
en|Commando and were used to capture high ground earning praise from the commander of I 
en|Corps Thereafter the war was largely static and the Centurions were used as artillery against 
en|the infantry attacks which generally happened at The Patton was intended to replace the Patton 
en|and Sherman tanks It had a gun and a crew of Despite it being the 
en|primary tank of the US it never saw combat while in US service In early 
en|the US initiated the design of the Patton designated the with a The featured a 
en|new turret new redesigned hull and an improved suspension The hull machine gunner position was 
en|removed reducing the crew to On April the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes OTCM standardized the 
en|last of the Patton series tanks as the Patton Nearly were built from to The 
en|early designs up to the were powered by a gasoline engine which was coupled with 
en|an auxiliary engine The gas engines gave the tank a short operating range and were 
en|prone to catching fire when hit; this version was considered unreliable The heavy tank was 
en|manufactured at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant and the first units were accepted in The 
en|was designed to counter Soviet heavy tanks Its longranged cannon was designed to hit enemy 
en|tanks at extreme distances although it was never used in combat Of the built most 
en|went to the The tank was relatively underpowered and the drive systems were fragile The 
en|turret of the was larger than that of the or the to make room for 
en|the huge gun and the two loaders assigned to it in addition to the gunner 
en|and the commander The driver sat in the hull The gun was capable of elevation 
en|from to degrees The British introduced their Heavy Gun Tank Conqueror with the same gun 
en|as the into service in It stayed in service until the upgrading of Centurion tank 
en|to the gun having removed its purpose While the US Army deactivated its heavy armor 
en|units with the reception of the new series main battle tanks in the remaining stayed

en|disappearance of the heavy tank from US forces came the full acceptance of the main 
en|battle tank in for the US Army and later for the US Marine The British 
en|successor to Centurion was Chieftain in Chieftain was heavily armoured and had a gun following 
en|a doctrine of long range fire and survivability that would be needed against the more 
en|numerous Warsaw Pact tanks in the event of an invasion of West Germany Tanks for

en|approximately fifty seven tanks were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced 
en|by Sheridan tanks The flamethrower tank nicknamed the Zippo was an variant used in Vietnam 
en|When US forces commenced redeployment operations many of the Pattons were turned over to the 
en|Army of the Republic of Vietnam ARVN forces in particular creating the ARVN Tank Regiment; 
en|which supplemented their Walker Bulldog units During the North Vietnamese Army NVA Easter Offensive in 
en|tank clashes between NVA and ARVN units became commonplace but on April tankers of the 
en|Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantrytank team which was equipped with the new 
en|Malyutka NATO designation Sagger wire guided antitank missile During this battle one Patton tank and 
en|one Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle ACAV were destroyed becoming the first losses to the Sagger 
en|missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the 
en|Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in In the the upgrade was developed to 
en|allow the vehicle to carry the heavier gun This was designed to bring the up 
en|to speed with the tanks then in regular use Most of the were placed into 
en|service with reserve units by this time By the the were phased out The performed 
en|in Vietnam in the infantrysupport role However there were few actual tank versus tank battles 
en|The provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms mines and rocketpropelled grenades The 
en|plans were laid in the US in the late fifties for a tank with a 
en|main gun and a redesigned hull offering better armor protection The resulting largely resembled the 
en|it was based on but has significant differences The mounted a bore evacuated main gun 
en|had a hull with a straight front slope whereas the hull was rounded had three 
en|support rollers per side to the five and had road wheels constructed from aluminum rather 
en|than steel The hull of the was a single piece steel casting divided into three 
en|compartments with the driver in front fighting compartment in the middle and engine at the 
en|The driver looked through three day periscopes one of which could be replaced by a 
en|night vision Initially the had essentially the same turret shape as the but this was 
en|subsequently replaced with a distinctive "needlenose" design that minimized frontal crosssection to enemy fire The 
en|was the last US main battle tank to utilize homogeneous steel armor for protection It 
en|was also the last to feature either the machine gun or an escape hatch under 
en|the hull Originally designated the the new vehicle was put into production in reclassified as 
en|the and entered service in Over all variants were constructed In the was upgraded to 
en|the This new variant which stayed in production until featured a larger bettershaped turret and 
en|improvements to the armor protection and shock absorbers The was also equipped with a stabilization 
en|system for the main gun However the was still not able to fire on the 
en|move as the system only kept the gun pointed in the same general direction while 
en|the tank was traveling cross country It did however enable the coaxial machine gun to 
en|be brought to bear while moving The Sheridan was initiated when the replacement for the 
en|Walker Bulldog the Light Tank was canceled The need for even lighter weight to make 
en|the tank transportable presented the design with a particularly difficult problem; guns capable of defeating 
en|modern tanks at reasonable ranges were so large that they demanded a large vehicle to 
en|carry them so large that they couldn't be used as a "light" tank The use 
en|of HEAT rounds instead of conventional penetrating ammunition could address this but HEAT rounds work 
en|better at larger calibers Gun weight is typically the product of caliber and muzzle velocity 
en|so in the case of the they sacrificed the muzzle velocity producing the lowvelocity but 
en|relatively largecaliber HEAT rounds fired by the could defeat any contemporary tank at shorter ranges 
en|but its low velocity made it difficult to use at longer ranges especially against moving 
en|targets The large lowvelocity gun was also ideal for infantry support where higher performance antitank 
en|guns would often fire right through soft targets and their smallcaliber guns left little room 
en|for explosive filler The Sheridan tank would thus be ideal for both direct fire support 
en|as well as shortdistance antitank engagements The only niche where the Sheridan was not ideal 
en|was the medium and longrange antitank engagement The muzzle velocity was so low that a 
en|HEAT round fired at longer ranges would have to be "lofted" making aiming difficult and 
en|the flight time would be so long that a moving target would be very difficult 
en|to hit However it appeared there was a solution to this problem by equipping the 
en|tank with gunfired antitank missiles For longer range engagements a missile would be fired instead 
en|of a HEAT round and although its velocity would also be relatively slow the guidance 
en|system would make a hit highly likely anyway The Sheridan appeared to offer the best 
en|of both worlds; for infantry support the large calibre gun allowed it to fire fullsized 
en|artillery rounds and canister shot while also giving it reasonable shortrange antitank performance from the 
en|same gun The Sheridan had a steel turret and aluminum hull It was powered by 
en|a large diesel engine The thus had excellent mobility able to run at speeds up 
en|to which at that time was unheard of for a tracked vehicle Swimming capability was 
en|provided by a flotation screen Production started on late July and entered service in June 
en|More than were built between and Total cost of the program was billion The vehicle 
en|proved to be very noisy and unreliable under combat conditions The armor was thin enough 
en|that it could be penetrated even by heavy machine gun rounds as well as being 
en|highly vulnerable to mines Firing the gun would often adversely affect the delicate electronics which 
en|were at the early stages of transitioning to solid state so the missile and guidance 
en|system was omitted from vehicles deployed to Vietnam The gun had problems with cracks developing 
en|near the breech after repeated firing Most field units were modified to help address the 
en|problem but gun also was criticized for having too much recoil for the vehicle weight 
en|the second and even third road wheels coming clear off the ground when the main 
en|gun fired The Sheridan saw extensive action in the Vietnam War being assigned to nearly 
en|all armored cavalry squadrons in country In armored cavalry units began replacing their Patton tanks 
en|The battle reports from the troops were sometimes glowing while the reports higher up the 
en|chain of command were often negative A evaluation of the vehicles found the was employed 
en|in reconnaissance night patrol and road clearing accumulating road miles and combat missions with a

en|infantry who were desperate for directfire support which generally served in combination with ACAVs as 
en|armored cavalry units consisted of both and as part of their TOE Armor units consisted 
en|solely of tanks minus headquarters company and Mechanized Infantry units consisted solely of In this 
en|role the real problem with the Sheridan was its limited ammunition load of only rounds 
en|and missiles though in Vietnam service were not equipped with missiles or their guidance equipment 
en|increasing the basic load of conventional rounds A common fieldmodification was to mount a large 
en|steel shield known as an "ACAV set" Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle around the commander's gun 
en|allowing it to be fired with some level of protection The driver has an unusual 
en|rotating hatch which has vision blocks when rotated forward Included with the set was an 
en|extra layer of steel belly armor which was bolted onto the vehicle's bottom although only 
en|covering from the front to halfway to the end possibly due to weight reasons A 
en|standard modification made during the was the addition of the "Cereal Bowl" commander's cupola This 
en|mod came about due to the broken rib effect that occurred when the Sheridan fired 
en|conventional rounds the recoil would pitch the TC against the armor plating resulting in cracked 
en|ribs The US Army began to phase out the Sheridan in although at the time 
en|there was no real replacement Nevertheless the Airborne were able to keep them on until 
en|The Sheridan was the only airdeployable tank in the inventory and as an elite force 
en|they had considerably more "pull" than general infantry and armor units who were forced to 
en|get rid of them Their units were later upgraded to the model including a thermal 
en|sighting system for the commander and gunner The Sheridan's only air drop in combat occurred 
en|during Operation Just Cause in Panama in when fourteen were deployed; four were transported by 
en|Galaxies and ten were dropped by air but two Sheridans were destroyed upon The Sheridans' 
en|performance received mixed reviews They were lauded by their operators and some commanders as providing 
en|firepower in needed situations to destroy hard targets However the Sheridans' employment of only HEAT 
en|rounds limited their effectiveness against reinforced concrete construction Fiftyone Sheridans were deployed in the Gulf 
en|War as some of the first tanks sent They would not be very effective against 
en|the Russianbuilt Their role was limited by age and light armor to reconnaissance duties possibly 
en|or less Shillelagh missiles were at Iraqi bunkers these fewer than a halfdozen missiles were 
en|the only time that the Shillelagh had been fired in a combat environment from the 
en|inventory of the aforementioned missiles produced Several attempts to upgun or replace the Sheridan have 
en|been made but none were successful Several experimental versions of the Sheridan mounting a new 
en|turret carrying a gun were made but the resulting recoil was too great Several possible 
en|replacements for the were tested as a part of the Armored Gun System and Expeditionary 
en|tank efforts of the early and late respectively but none of these entered service The 
en|Stryker Mobile Gun System has replaced the light tank role of the United States During 
en|the the US and West Germany entered a joint project for a new tank common 
en|to both armies and intended to enter service in the The project was technically advanced 
en|with sophisticated suspension a low silhouette spaced armor and advanced gun systems but suffered from 
en|excessive costs and the Germans pulled out of the project at the end of the 
en|decade After Vietnam the Patton was upgraded and designated the It featured an entirely new 
en|lowprofile turret with a commander's machinegun cupola on top giving the commander a good view 
en|and field of fire while under armor but spoiling the low profile It also featured 
en|a cannon which fired conventional rounds as well as guided missiles The proved a disappointment 
en|though technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks The system was phased out 
en|from active units by and the turrets scrapped Most of the tanks were rebuilt as 
en|In work began on the variant It featured a number of technological enhancements including smoke 
en|dischargers a new rangefinder and ballistic computer and a turret stabilization system In addition it 
en|reverted to the cannon All active American eventually underwent the conversion to the model The 
en|was phased out of US service in The German Leopard tank another armed tank was 
en|introduced in It was sold widely to several nations in NATO as well as worldwide 
en|It was followed in by the Leopard with a smoothbore gun In prototypes of a 
en|new tank which became the Abrams were delivered by Chrysler Defense and General Motors armed 
en|with a rifled cannon The Chrysler Defense design was selected for development as the In

en|Patton as the autoloader was considered unproven and risky It was armed with the same 
en|gun as the Over Abrams were produced and first entered US Army service in About 
en|upgraded Abrams were produced and used the German smoothbore cannon improved armor and a CBRN

en|based on Polish hulls with other parts of mixed origin These machines were not equipped 
en|with uptodate equipment such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders and their effectiveness in modern 
en|combat was very limited The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal 
en|sights and sabot rounds used by Coalition armour This equipment enabled them to engage and 
en|destroy Iraqi tanks from more than three times the range that Iraqi tanks could engage 
en|coalition tanks Some Iraqi crews even fired training rounds at the US and British tanks 
en|These rounds purchased in great number during the Iran–Iraq War due to their inexpensive cost

en|in March during the invasion In addition to the and tanks that Iraq had the 
en|most feared to US armoured forces were the tanks in the Iraqi forces Only Republican

en|combat power of Republican Guard divisions The only chance for the Asad Babil against American 
en|tanks was to lure them to close range combat or trying to ambush them from

en|The Medical Cadet Corp MCC is a program of the Seventhday Adventist Church Adventist church 
en|started in the in the United States with the intention of preparing young men of 
en|draft age for military service in noncombatant roles The training included drill first aid military 
en|courtesies organization of medical corps defense against chemical warfare principles of anatomy and physiology physical 
en|exercises and character The program was temporarily suspended at the end of World War II 
en|It was reactivated in and in the next few years was adapted internationally The program 
en|was deactivated by the General Conference of Seventhday Adventists General Conference in the early but 
en|continued independently in a few locations with an emphasis on rescue and disaster response In 
en|the Medical Cadet Corps a component of the World Service Organization that is under the 
en|umbrella of the General Conference Department of Adventist Chaplaincy Ministries was reactivated as a worldwide 
en|program Divisions When the Seventhday Adventist movement was formally organized in during the height of 
en|the American Civil War military conscription was one of the first major challenges to be 
en|addressed by the fledgling denomination Even before Adventist beliefs about combatancy generally fell into one 
en|of three opinion groups pacifists who felt any military service was a violation of God's 
en|command to not commit murder; militant abolitionists who felt that military service would honor God's 
en|will in ending slavery; and noncombatants who believed it to be their Christian duty to 
en|support the government in roles which did not violate the fourth and sixth commandments see 
en|Ten Commandments This latter position ultimately emerged as the denomination's policy and set precedent for 
en|future periods of conscription in the United States When conscription became law in March most 
en|drafted Adventists took advantage of the option to purchase an exemption which cost per person 
en|This sum was not easy for many to come by and church leaders encouraged all 
en|members to contribute toward purchasing these exemptions for drafted members In February the conscription law 
en|was amended to allow conscientious objectors to serve the military in noncombatant roles A short 
en|time later this provision was revised so that it would apply only to recognized conscientious 
en|objectors Church leaders quickly moved to acquire this recognition from state governors in Michigan Wisconsin 
en|Illinois Pennsylvania and finally the Federal Following the Civil War the United States military returned 
en|to an allvolunteer force The Indian Wars and Spanish–American War did not require large numbers 
en|of soldiers Adventist denominational history is mostly silent in regard to these conflicts When World 
en|War I erupted in Europe there was much more cause for concern The Seventhday Adventist 
en|Church looked at the issue in the Autumn Council of in the General Conference Committee 
en|for a way in keeping with the church's noncombatant beliefs to allow the young men 
en|of the church to fulfill their obligations and the medical military service was the direction 
en|they took However since the Adventist church had grown both inside and outside of the 
en|United States Members in Europe were divided by political and battle lines sometimes isolating them 
en|from the rest of the church The war in Europe began so quickly it was 
en|difficult for the church to form a cohesive policy or to support drafted church members 
en|In the United States efforts to support drafted church members were more orderly and the 
en|government continued to make provisions for conscientious objectors However misunderstandings did arise between some Adventists 
en|draftees who took extreme positions and their company officers who often did not understand or 
en|respect the position of conscientious objectors It is unknown how many Adventists were actually drafted 
en|during World War I Charles Longacre who was in charge of church military relations in 
en|the United States for most of World War I claimed that American Seventhday Adventists were 
en|courtmartialed during the war and were imprisoned in disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth at the 
en|end of the war The denomination's initiative to support draftees and the war effort in 
en|general was multifaceted encouraging church members to support government conservation programs calling for preinduction medical 
en|training providing camp pastors and planning to set up Servicemen's Rest Homes in Europe The 
en|short time between the United States' entry into the war and its end meant that 
en|some of these actions were not implemented and the effectiveness of others is The experience 
en|of American Adventists during World War I generated several lessons which shaped the church's response 
en|to the draft during World War II the Korean War and the Vietnam War First 
en|Adventists working in the Medical Corps United States Army experienced the fewest conflicts regarding the 
en|keeping of Sabbath and bearing of arms Second preinduction military medical training enhanced the effectiveness 
en|of Adventists who did serve and reduced the problems they faced Third educating church members 
en|regarding their obligations to both God and society reduced the extremism which often led to 
en|Following World War I a number of faculty members in Adventist colleges believed that premilitary 
en|training and guidance should continue to be given students of draft age At Emmanuel Missionary 
en|College now Andrews University in Lewis S Williams started a program but when it was 
en|criticized as being "too militaristic" it was stopped At Walla Walla College now Walla Walla 
en|University students directed a set of questions to the General Conference regarding whether it was 
en|better to enlist or be drafted clarification regarding appropriate duties for Sabbath whether it was 
en|ever okay to bear arms and whether the moral nature of a conflict changed one's 
en|responsibility for military service The students' questions were discussed by a General Conference committee of 
en|seven individuals charged with studying noncombatancy However this group could not reach a consensus so 
en|the questions remained The College Medical Corps was founded by Everett N Dick at Union 
en|College in as a way to train males for noncombatant medic military service The Medical 
en|Cadet Corps was founded for students of the College of Medical Evangelists in by Cyril 
en|B In Dick presented his program to other Adventist educators which led to other college 
en|adopting the In in Glendale California a new Pathfinder group was founded which also added 
en|military drills from the With other Adventist colleges following suit by installing similar programs the 
en|Fall Council of the General Conference Executive Committee in gave it official sanction and centralization 
en|under the name of Medical Cadet Corps In various places a Women's Cadet Corps also 
en|The GC appointed Dick as the denominational program and recommended that all Adventist colleges start 
en|a MCC When the General Conference met for its Autumn Council in shortly after fighting 
en|broke out in Europe church leaders finally sanctioned the Union College Medical Corps program but 
en|formally adopted Courville's Medical Cadet Corps name although the program would always focus on preparing 
en|enlisted soldiers About this time Everett Dick and two other leaders met with officials of 
en|the US Surgeon General's office to establish a unified curriculum for the MCC Thus started 
en|a twentyyear relationship between Dick and officers of the Surgeon General's office This relationship resulted 
en|in a curriculum continuously revised to meet evolving military standards and recognition for Adventist soldiers 
en|which routinely placed them in the Army's Medical Nearly every Adventist college and secondary school 
en|in the United States participated in the MCC program Each one chose its own uniform 
en|but patches were used in common Training manuals also differed from location to location Everett 
en|Dick on temporary leave from Union College was placed in charge of the central region 
en|of the country Chris P Sorenson was in charge of the eastern third and Floyd 
en|G Ashbaugh was in charge of the program west of the Rocky Mountains Each man 
en|was expected to promote the program in his region and to conduct officer training camps 
en|which trained leaders for the corps established on Adventist academic campuses and in some places 
en|churches When this system developed flaws Dick was asked to direct the program nationwide which 
en|he did until he returned to fulltime work at Union College in Women first received 
en|training at Atlantic Union College and many academies required training for both men and women 
en|Summer camps were held in order to facilitate training for men who were not attending 
en|Adventist academies or colleges With the cessation of World War II many campuses stopped teaching 
en|the courses Only Union College and Southwestern Junior College now Southwestern Adventist University continued their 
en|MCC programs without With the end of World War II the program ended The Corps 
en|was reactivated in in response to the reestablishment of the draft continuing in parallel with 
en|the draft with its end in in the US In other countries with mandatory military 
en|service or a draft their similar program still The MCC was officially reactivated in with 
en|an officer's training camp in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp now Mountain Park near 
en|Beulah Colorado The MCC program took on a different feel during this decade Uniforms were 
en|standardized and all officers were required to train at national camps so that every MCC 
en|unit across the nation operated under the same guidelines and instruction Leadership was centralized under 
en|Everett Dick who as MCC commander held the rank of colonel and beginning in was 
en|also associate secretary of the War Service After Everett Dick resigned in Clark Smith who 
en|had worked with Dick since the MCC's beginning at Union College in became the commander 
en|Camp Doss continued to be held in the summers through at least However support for 
en|the MCC in the United States declined after Dick's retirement perhaps more due to the 
en|US Army's implementation of its own noncombatant training program at Fort Sam Houston Most Adventist 
en|colleges and academies stopped offering MCC courses by Interest further declined as the war in 
en|Vietnam grew increasingly unpopular When the draft in the United States ended in the General 
en|Conference closed the denominationwide program Similarly MCC programs in other countries which were strong while 
en|the countries were under military dictatorships declined when more democratic governments gained power The MCC 
en|continued to operate locally in some areas but with an emphasis on disaster response and 
en|collaboration with Adventist Community Services rather than preinduction military medical In a summer camp training 
en|program was held at Grand Ledge Michigan on the Michigan Conference camp meeting grounds Named 
en|for Desmond T Doss the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor this 
en|camp became an annual event until about Doss himself frequently attended an attraction that helped 
en|bring more young men to the camp each year From until Everett Dick commanded Camp 
en|Doss aided by a core group of MCC leaders who gathered at Grand Ledge each 
en|summer from across the nation The camp also attracted international visitors interested in creating MCC

en|Series by posing the fastest lap in qualifying and he held the advantage until he 
en|made a pit stop for the hard compound tyres at the end of lap six 
en|after being put under pressure by Leimer Coletti retook the lead after all drivers made 
en|their pit stops but he lost the position to Leimer on lap because of tyre 
en|degradation Leimer held the first position for the rest of the race to claim his 
en|first victory in the Series since the Catalunya sprint race and the third of his 
en|career Stéphane Richelmi began the sprint race from pole position but he lost the lead 
en|to Coletti at the second corner on the first lap Although he was caught by

en|the season due to hot and unpredictable weather temperatures and the abrasive asphalt surface of 
en|the track which made tyre management As in the round tyre supplier Pirelli brought two 
en|types of tyre to the race two dry compounds soft "options" and hard "primes" The 
en|soft compound tyres were identified by a yellow stripe on their sidewalls and the hard

en|"unacceptable" reaction and Bird was given a threeplace grid penalty for impeding With five minutes 
en|left of qualifying Bird delayed Cecotto at turns five and six because he was warming 
en|his tyres Bird then turned off the racing line to allow Cecotto through as the 
en|latter drew alongside him leaving turn six Cecotto however retaliated for Bird's earlier impediment by 
en|swerving to his right going towards the seventh corner This put Bird into the grass 
en|on the righthand side of the The first race was held over kilometres or minutes

en|drivers The first retirement came on the opening lap as the field braked for turn 
en|nine and Ericsson misjudged his braking point and ran into the rear of Palmer's car 
en|Ericsson's vehicle stopped in the barrier alongside the Once a rhythm was established it became 
en|apparent that tyre wear would become a factor as Leimer put Coletti under heavy pressure 
en|for first place but he withstood all of his It gave Calado Nasr and Evans 
en|who were duelling over third the opportunity to draw On lap three QuaifeHobbs mistimed an 
en|overtaking manoeuvre on his teammate de Jong at turn and they both of them retired 
en|after making contact with each Coletti struggled as his soft compound tyres degrading and he 
en|made a pit stop for the hard compound tyres as soon as drivers were permitted 
en|by series officials to do so at the end of lap That allowed Leimer into 
en|the lead He immediately began setting a series of consecutive fast laps in clear air 
en|in the hope of providing himself with a small advantage over Coletti after his pit 
en|stop However Leimer's tactic greatly reduced his pace in comparison to In the meantime Abt 
en|triggered localised yellow flags on lap ten when he spun off the track and marshals 
en|were required to extract his Leimer emerged close behind Coletti after he made his pit 
en|stop on the eleventh The yettopit Bird became the new leader when Leimer made his 
en|pit stop but his opportunity of claiming a strong result was diminished when he received 
en|a drivethrough penalty for overtaking under yellow flag Palmer assumed first place on lap twelve 
en|and kept the position until his lap pit stop to have the soft compound tyres 
en|installed on his On lap Evans and Richelmi ran wide at turn one and Bird 
en|overtook them for Leal overtook Cecotto for fifth on the next Coletti retook the first 
en|position but started to struggle on his hard compound tyres which allowed Leimer to close 
en|up as his tyres degraded and had frequent wheel lockups However Leimer could not immediately 
en|overtake Coletti because he lacked the straightline speed on the straight linking turns and Leimer's 
en|awareness of Calado getting closer grew more as the race progressed and he knew he 
en|had to get ahead of Coletti as soon as possible He tried doing this leaving 
en|the final corner on lap but was unsuccessful despite getting a better exit than On 
en|the next lap Coletti put Leimer onto the outside line of the circuit but he 
en|was overtaken on the racing line by Leimer at the exit of turn four for 
en|the lead By this point Calado got close to Coletti and outbraked him at the 
en|final corner in his attempt at passing but ran deep Coletti got back through but 
en|Calado then tucked into his slipstream and had the grip to overtake him around the 
en|inside at the first corner for second Further down the order Haryanto hit Varhaug while 
en|battling for position and Dillmann swerved to avoid getting involved in the duel Evans locked 
en|his tyres and this enabled Trummer to get ahead of him and take over ninth 
en|Upfront Leimer set a series of lap times under the one minute and seconds range 
en|in clear air to enlarge his advantage over Calado to two Leimer crossed the startfinish 
en|line at the end of lap to claim his third victory in the Series and 
en|his first since the Catalunya sprint Calado was second and Coletti completed the podium in 
en|third Off the podium Nasr took fourth Leal had the best result of his career 
en|in the Series at the time in fifth Palmer finished sixth and Bird recovered from 
en|his penalty to claim Richelmi finished eighth and took the pole position for the sprint 
en|Completing the top ten were Trummer and Evans The rest of the classified finishers were 
en|Binder Cecotto Daly Dillmann Varhaug Giovesi Ceccon Rosenzweig Canamasas Haryanto and After the race the 
en|stewards deemed QuaifeHobbs responsible for the clash with his teammate de Jong on lap three 
en|and he was issued a fiveplace grid penalty for the sprint The second race began 
en|under cloudy weather conditions at local time on Ma was ruled unfit to compete because 
en|the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile medical doctor diagnosed him with gastroenteritis which led to extreme 
en|At the start of the formation lap Palmer stalled his car and was required to 
en|start from the pit As a result Nasr used the vacant spot left by his 
en|teammate Palmer to get ahead of the slowstarting Bird and Leal on the inside line 
en|going into the first turn However it was the sixthplaced Coletti who took the lead 
en|away from Richelmi because he made a strong getaway and steered onto the outside line 
en|to pass him leaving the second Going into the braking zone for turn four Calado 
en|got caught out by Leimer and mistimed an overtaking manoeuvre on him and hit the 
en|rightrear corner of his The impact dislodged Calado's front wing and it folded under his 
en|This rendered Calado unable to steer and had limited braking capabilities since he could not 
en|control his vehicle which launched over the grass on the inside of the circuit He 
en|ploughed into Leal and Bird at high speed and all three drivers instantly retired in 
en|the turn four gravel Richelmi was overtaken by Nasr at turn one at the start 
en|of the second lap and made it stick at the turn two switchback The top 
en|three of Coletti Nasr and Richelmi pulled out a onesecond advantage over Evans in fourth 
en|place with Cecotto in fifth and sixthplaced Leimer who continued to circulate the track despite 
en|his incident with Calado on the first From then on Coletti opened his lead over 
en|Nasr to two and a half seconds after setting a series of fastest laps However 
en|he put himself a risk of putting his tyres under too much stress and creating 
en|an identical situation of him losing the chance of victory to a driver who better 
en|conserved his With the lead now stabilised attention focused on Palmer further down the order 
en|as he moved his way through the field and got to midway through the race 
en|while Ericsson gained two places to be in On lap Richelmi outbraked himself and ran 
en|deep onto the runoff area at the turn Evans had conserved his tyres in the 
en|laps beforehand and overtook Richelmi for He then repelled a counterattack from Richelmi entering the 
en|first On lap Leimer found the damage to his car from the first lap incident 
en|with Calado caused too much rear tyre wear and a sudden loss of grip put 
en|him into a gravel trap at turn eleven and dropped out of the top Tyre 
en|degradation became a factor in the final laps as Nasr lowered Coletti's lead to seconds 
en|and later to sixtenths of a second by the start of the final It was 
en|not enough for Nasr to get close enough to challenge Coletti who managed the gap 
en|and his tyres to clinch the third victory of his career in the Nasr finished 
en|eighttenths of a second adrift in second and Evans became the youngest driver to claim 
en|a podium in the Series in Off the podium Richelmi finished fourth and Cecotto benefited

en|the stewards and he was required to serve it at the next feature race of 
en|the season at the Bahrain The top three drivers in both races appeared on the 
en|podium to collect their trophies and in separate press conferences Leimer spoke of his satisfaction 
en|over winning his first race for almost two years and revealed his goal was to 
en|win the opening race of the season "I think it was important for me and 
en|the team that we’re already at the front Everything worked really well today Mentally this 
en|win is a real boost for me and the team We’ve worked really hard during 
en|the winter and it’s paid Calado stated his slow start was caused by cold tyres 
en|and him starting on the circuit's dirty side Nevertheless he congratulated Leimer on his victory 
en|and said he was still happy with his secondplace Thirdplaced Coletti said he was happy 
en|with the result despite problems with his tyres "I scored good points The championship is 
en|long and we have the time to find a solution to make sure the car 
en|is even better during the race I’m pretty He revealed his tyres began to degrade 
en|from the fourth lap which prompted him to make an early pit stop for the 
en|hard compound tyres because he feared losing time and Leimer overtaking After the sprint race 
en|Coletti stated work put into his car overnight aided his race and emphasised the importance 
en|about racing in Malaysia's hot weather conditions "It was really hot out there and very 
en|difficult especially when you have to think about the tyres and concentrate on doing everything 
en|right because any little mistake can destroy your tyres and the race can be over 
en|So it’s really not easy in the Nasr said he was happy with his secondplace 
en|finish and revealed that was his goal for the sprint race before discussing his duel 
en|with Coletti "What I could see from the car was that Stefano built a gap 
en|and was safe from there After that I was mainly trying to save my tyres 
en|as best as I could When it was eight laps to go I started to 
en|push to try and catch up with him but my rear tyres did not last 
en|long enough I think that’s something we need to work on but I’m still pleased 
en|with second place I’ve scored good points for the Thirdplaced Evans said his team adjusted 
en|his car to improve its balance for the sprint race and stated he did not 
en|try to get second because of the high level of tyre wear "I was hoping 
en|maybe Felipe would have caught Stefano and maybe made contact with him but that did 
en|not happen Laughs I am satisfied with third in my debut I think we’re in 
en|a good position for the rest of the Since Sepang was the first round of 
en|the season Coletti became the early leader of the Drivers' Championship with points Leimer's feature 
en|race victory put him eleven points behind in second and Nasr was a further point

en|The story cycle around Kae and Sinilau is well known in Polynesian mythology found in 
en|several places see notes This article describes the Tongan version of which the main source 
en|is an old poem Ko e folau ʻa Kae – The voyage of Kae published 
en|in and some other incomplete manuscripts The third player Longopoa in this respect is an 
en|outsider It starts with Loʻau from Haʻamea one of the many Loʻau known in Tongan 
en|history Haʻamea may be the place of his lepa in central Tongatapu or it may 
en|be an alternative name for Samoa Haʻamoa in Tongan He ran a famous navigation school 
en|on an artificial lake lepa near Loʻau's boat was either a tongiaki an old sailing 
en|boat of Tongan design or a kalia a better more modern design originating from Fiji 
en|One day Loʻau got tired of people taunting him all the time about when he 
en|would go for a real trip So he had his big canoe dragged to the 
en|sea and told his matāpule chief attendants Kae and Longopoa to accompany him to some 
en|nearby islands So they went But when they passed Haʻapai Loʻau told them to 'sail 
en|on past the shore' The same thing happened at Vavaʻu and then Niuatoputapu and then 
en|Samoa and then Niuafoʻou and then ʻUvea and then No one realised that Loʻau had 
en|already decided from the beginning to go beyond the horizon and not to return He 
en|wanted to go to the land of the talking puko trees probably Pulotu The ship 
en|steered on downwards ie south or west in Tongan navigation sense They came to a 
en|white sea; they came to a floating pumice sea; they came to a slimy Eventually 
en|they reached the horizon at the end of the sky There there is a hole 
en|in the sky and a great whirlpool in the ocean where the waters go in 
en|when there is an ebb tide in Tonga and the waters come out at flood 
en|tide There was also a reef with a pandanus tree and a large rock The 
en|mast of the ship got stuck in the branches of the tree and had to 
en|be freed This was done with a push and that push caused the ship either 
en|to disappear in the whirlpool or through the opening in the sky lost in space 
en|never to be seen again Kae and Longopoa did not await this happening They had 
en|agreed to desert this foolish trip and they made it back to the reef Kae 
en|clinging to the tree and Longopoa to the rock When it got dark and the 
en|flood current came out again Kae suggested Longopoa that they should find a way to 
en|escape from the island every man for himself He plunged in the sea and swam 
en|away At midnight he landed on a sandy island; other sources say many days later 
en|He saw eight dead whales on the shore and hundreds of neiufi fish or according 
en|to other sources fewer whales and huge man eating sharks luckily also dead It was 
en|the lair of the kanivatu a giant bird like the roc which was known to 
en|be a man eater too Kae wisely hid for the night between two of the 
en|whales The bird returned to its nest in the morning While it was preening its 
en|feathers Kae emerged and clung to one of its legs or the feathers of its 
en|breast according to some or of its wing according to some At midday the bird 
en|flew away over the ocean with his passenger and when Kae saw they were over 
en|land he let go The place where he landed was on the coral sand beach 
en|of ʻAkana Aʻana in Samoan the western part of ʻUpolu He was friendlily received by 
en|the high chief of the area Sinilau who gave him status more than he ever 
en|had gotten in Tonga but not enough to enter the kava So Kae stayed in 
en|Samoa for some time But then he was seized by a longing for Tonga to 
en|tell about all the wonderful things he had seen and he announced to Sinilau that 
en|he wanted to go Sinilau agreed and presented him with a farewell gift He would 
en|be allowed to ride on the back of Sinilau's twin whales Sinilau's had a daughter 
en|who one day ate a piece of whalemeat which was left over in the house 
en|She got pregnant and bore a twin who were named Tonga and Tunungatofuaʻa tofuaʻa They 
en|were whales Sinilau spoke "Go well Kae just tell the whales whereto to go But 
en|leave them in deep water at the coast And when you have reached your home 
en|before you go to your relatives prepare a bunch of coconuts scented oil some unpainted 
en|tapa and a floormat give it to them to return to me" This was a 
en|very modest request and Kae agreed Kae had the trip of his life Too soon 
en|he was back at Tongatapu at Poloʻa where the tidal flats start and it was 
en|just low tide He left the whales in shallow water and sped to Haʻamea He 
en|told his relatives what had happened and then shouted out to all his friends from 
en|Fatai and Matafonua and Lakepa and so on that they came with knives and spears 
en|and axes to slaughter those whales on the beach Tununga was killed cut in pieces 
en|the meat was distributed to all the chiefs of the different districts and eaten by 
en|the people of the whole island But Tonga was able to escape A depression in 
en|the middle of the tidal flats a fishing pool is still visible as a result 
en|of its struggle to get away Sinilau was extremely displeased about Kae's behaviour when Tonga 
en|told him what had happened after he had arrived at ʻAkana; with his back full 
en|of spears and without the promised items Sinilau called all the gods of Samoa to 
en|a council and ordered them to assemble at both Hunga Haʻapai and Hunga Tonga There 
en|they would have to cut coconut tree leaves to plait some baskets out of "Then 
en|tonight go around" Sinilau said "and collect the dung of all the people who partook 
en|in the meal From Muifonua to ʻEua to Fangaleʻounga to Hihifo to Finally put Kae 
en|on top of the shit and bring everything back to me" So it was done 
en|and Kae was brought into Sinilau's boatshed he did not even wake up As dawn 
en|was approaching a rooster crowed "That stupid rooster" Kae mumbled half asleep "he crows like 
en|Sinilau's rooster At daylight I shall kill it and eat it" He thought he was 
en|still at home on Tongatapu But when daylight had come he saw that he was 
en|there no longer but in a certain boatshed in Samoa And a stern Sinilau with 
en|a royal turban on his head sat at the entrance Kae had nothing to say 
en|Sinilau threw him out to the waiting gods who fell on him and ate him 
en|Although others say that Sinialu threw him in a predug grave noting that Kae was 
en|not worth more once a commoner always a commoner Meanwhile a big kava bowl was 
en|brought and all the parts and shit the gods had collected in Tonga was thrown 
en|in and see after having left it to itself for a while suddenly Tunungatofuaʻa came 
en|back to life He was only missing one tooth as the Tongans had brought as 
en|a gift to the Tuʻi Tonga in Muʻa which had made it untouchable even for 
en|the gods Sinilau suggested that Tununga should not try to smile too much Meanwhile Longopoa 
en|was left behind on his rock at the end of the world Once Kae had 
en|left his pandanus tree the other hesitated a while but then finally he swam away 
en|too He reached a small deserted island where only a puko tree grew But it 
en|was a magic tree it talked And when Longopoa cried that he was hungry the 
en|tree instructed him to make and light a ʻumu and then to break off one 
en|of its branches and to roast it When at the end he opened the oven 
en|see it was full with roasted pig fowl yams and so forth He ate his 
en|belly full and slept But next day he cried again he wanted to go back 
en|home to Tonga The tree then told him that tonight the gods would go fishing 
en|He should ask them to let him go with them and he would carry their 
en|bag for them "Make a hole in the basket so that the fish drops out 
en|and it does not fill too swiftly Because once the basket is full the gods 
en|will stop But if not they will go on and on fishing And when you 
en|reach your home island crow like a rooster so the gods will think the night 
en|is over Now also break off another branch of me and take it with you 
en|As soon as you come home and while it is still night plant it A 
en|young puko tree will grow out of it and provide you and your people with 
en|food as I did yesterday Do not go to see your relatives first because if 
en|you plant this branch after the day has dawned it will only grow to be 
en|just an ordinary tree" So the friendly puko tree said and so it happened The 
en|gods fished and fished and when they reached Samoa they were surprised to hear from 
en|their new carrier that the basket was not yet full And at Niuatoputapu it was 
en|still not full Next they reached Tonga Longopoa jumped overboard ran ashore and crowed like 
en|a rooster The gods made themselves scarce Overjubilant Longopoa directly went to see his family 
en|Only when the new day had come he remembered the love of the puko tree 
en|But then it was too late the blessings were spoilt and the puko trees of

en|In TCPalms interview Herman Raucher mentions that the film with the same title gave birth 
en|to the book Summer of Raucher wrote the screenplay for the film version The movie 
en|was written first When the film was in postproduction someone told him to write the 
en|book about Summer of to help publicize the picture So Raucher wrote the book in 
en|about three or four The book became a bestseller prior to the film's release so 
en|the film was publicized as "from Herman Raucher's national best Both the film and this 
en|book are based on the real incidents that happened during the summer of in Raucher's 
en|life Raucher's novelization of the screenplay with the dedication "To those I love past and 
en|present" serves more as the tribute to his friend Oscar Seltzer that he had intended 
en|the film to be with the focus of the book being more on the two 
en|boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy The book also mentions Seltzer's death which is 
en|absent from the film adaptation There are differences between the real life incident that happened 
en|during the night and the incident in the film The book stayed faithful to the 
en|real incident that happened during that night In TCPalms Raucher pointed out that the real 
en|Dorothy was drinking heavily when he visited Dorothy during night time This is implied in 
en|the book But in the film it is only implied that Dorothy "may" have been 
en|drinking But when Dorothy appears to Hermie in the film visually there is no indication 
en|of her being drunk at all In the film Dorothy is completely aware of what 
en|is going on In both the real incident and in the book the song that 
en|was played on the phonograph record was "That Old Feeling" In the film the composer 
en|Michel Legrand wrote a new score for the dancing scene The real life incident took 
en|place in Nantucket Island But the name of the island is not mentioned in the 
en|film In the book the name of the island was changed to Patchett Island In 
en|the real incident the real Dorothy kept calling Hermie "Pete" thinking that Hermie was her 
en|husband while they both were in bed There is no indication in the film that 
en|Dorothy is imagining Hermie as her husband Pete In the book it is only mentioned 
en|that Dorothy talked about private things that Hermie was not familiar with Unlike the film 
en|the book shows that the tears come out of Hermie's eyes while the music "That 
en|Old Feeling" is playing For the film Raucher admitted about moving the order of certain 
en|events around and interchanging some dialogue There are several differences between Dorothy in the book 
en|and Dorothy in the film One of several changes is where Hermie's tongue gets hurt 
en|by the coffee Both in the film and in the book Dorothy helps Hermie by 
en|providing ice when Hermie's tongue gets hurt by the hot coffee Unlike Dorothy in the 
en|book Dorothy in the film repeatedly apologizes to Hermie for the coffee being too hot 
en|and makes sure that he is doing fine In the film Dorothy moves on to 
en|her work and also to a conversation "only" after she makes sure that Hermie's tongue 
en|is feeling better But in the book there is no indication of an apology from 
en|Dorothy In the book when Hermie was "able" to look up to see what Dorothy 
en|was doing after getting relief from the ice cubes in the coffee he saw her

en|was armed with a main battery of ten guns all on the centerline making her 
en|the most powerful battleship in the world at the time of her construction She was 
en|also the first battleship of the US Navy to be capable of steaming at full 
en|speed for continuous hours without suffering a breakdown Delaware served in the Atlantic Fleet throughout 
en|her career During World War I she sailed to Great Britain to reinforce the British 
en|Grand Fleet in the Battle Squadron She saw no action during the war however as 
en|both the British and Germans had abandoned direct confrontation with each other After the end 
en|of the war she returned to her peacetime duties of fleet maneuvers midshipmen cruises and 
en|goodwill visits to foreign ports Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty Delaware was 
en|retained until the new battleship USS Colorado was completed in at which point she was broken 
en|up for scrap in accordance with the treaty The two Delawareclass battleships were ordered in 
en|response to the British battleship HMS Dreadnought the first allbiggun battleship to enter service The previous 
en|American dreadnoughts the South Carolina class had been designed before the particulars of HMS Dreadnought 
en|were known The Navy decided that another pair of battleships should be built to counter 
en|the perceived superiority of Dreadnought over South Carolina and so Rear Admiral Washington L Capps 
en|prepared a design for a ship with an additional main battery gun turret to match 
en|Dreadnought's ten guns But unlike Dreadnought all ten of Delaware's guns could fire on the

en|battery of ten caliber Mark guns in five twin Mark gun turrets on the centerline 
en|two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward The other three turrets were 
en|placed aft of the superstructure The secondary battery consisted of caliber Mark guns mounted on

en|west In c late or early John Sperling is recorded by Christian Ignatius Latrobe as 
en|visiting architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe his brother in Sperling who already had a country seat 
en|at Dynes Hall a country house and acre estate in Great Maplestead Essex came from 
en|a wealthy family which had made its fortune in the London fur trade after emigrating 
en|from Sweden – and was only a year older than Latrobe who was at that 
en|time a pupil of S P Cockerell Nevertheless he commissioned Latrobe to design and build 
en|a new country house and hunting lodge in the Germanic tradition of the Jagdschloss on 
en|the site of the Bower Sperling chose to name the new house Hammerwood Lodge at 
en|this point probably as a romantic reference to the hammer used in the furnace of 
en|the iron forge which had existed in the area since the Middle Ages Latrobe supervised 
en|the build from the autumn of onwards its proximity to Ashdown House his second commission 
en|near Forest Row allowing for the sharing of craftsmen and suppliers of building materials – 
en|and for Latrobe to supervise both Trinder describes the design as comprising "a large Palladian

en|problems When his wife Lydia Sellon having died in childbirth in November he is thought 
en|to have suffered a breakdown Declared bankrupt and unable to pay some of his workmen 
en|he emigrated to America on November There is some doubt over whether Hammerwood was finished 
en|by this point; it is possible that the Sperlings supervised its completion in Latrobe's However 
en|the failure of a large investment in a Dublin distillery led the Sperlings to lose 
en|equivalent to approximately million in pounds; the artist and diarist Joseph Farington reported that they 
en|and their partners 'overbuilt themselves at a vast expense' Between and Sperling was compelled to 
en|give up both Hammerwood and his London home and to move back to his Dynes

en|Augustus Smith of Smith's Bank later part of NatWest in June for equating to approximately 
en|million in pounds of which was for the timber In the Smiths contracted S S

en|changes to the building this included raising the attic over the central block to create 
en|a low third floor whilst preserving Latrobe's façade Work began on May scholars Snadon and 
en|Fazio comment that "Teulon integrated his additions so carefully with the existing fabric that it 
en|is difficult at first glance to discern Extract from Oswald Augustus Smith's diary on the

en|Grinstead Additionally much of the village of Hammerwood which exists today the population of which 
en|reached a peak of in and some of the houses to the east of the 
en|village of Ashurst Wood were built during Smith's tenure as tied cottages for estate The 
en|Rev George Ferris Whidborne purchased Hammerwood from Oswald Augustus shortly before the latter's death Impressed 
en|by the unusual and abundant wildlife he moved his family from Dorset; the Whidbornes would 
en|live at Hammerwood from His eldest son was killed in the First World War; all 
en|three were at different times awarded the MC In the prep school in Tunbridge Wells 
en|which the Whidborne children had attended burned down; St Andrew's moved to Hammerwood whilst new 
en|premises were found in Forest Row Old boys remembered playing cricket against Ashdown House by

en|Margaret Whidborne to sell acres of the estate almost half of the land Three years 
en|later a further acres of farms were sold the house disposed of and the contents 
en|auctioned Two floors of servants' quarters on the northeast service wing which had been added 
en|during the century were demolished and left with acres of adjoining park and woodland the 
en|name of the estate was changed to Hammerwood Park; its place as a focal point 
en|of local life began to In the remains of the estate – comprising the house 
en|and acres of land – were taken up by Lt Col Stephen Hungerford Pollen CMG 
en|after a career in the British Army having been ADC to Lords Lansdowne and Elgin 
en|respective Viceroys of India winning medals for service in that country and South Africa and 
en|serving in the Tirah Expedition in His family were the first residents to enjoy an 
en|electricity supply and water from the mains the heating had by this time been converted 
en|to an oilfired system There remained a full complement of eleven or twelve – by 
en|differing accounts – indoor staff for the duration of the Pollens' time at Hammerwood and 
en|he contributed the land and a quarter of the building costs for the building of 
en|the Hammerwood and Holtye It is a strange coincidence that one of Lt Col Pollen's 
en|ancestors Richard Pollen brother of Sir John Pollen Bt married the daughter of S P 
en|Cockerell the architect under whom Latrobe After the death of Lt Col Pollen in the 
en|Kirwan Taylor family bought Hammerwood; they were the owners when the Second World War broke

en|Chattell born bought the estate dividing the house into eleven apartments However dry and wet 
en|rot became increasingly problematic and the house uninhabitable; its listed building description written after a 
en|visit in November noted that it was already 'empty and boarded up' and placed it 
en|at Grade II status it was later upgraded to Grade In rock band Led Zeppelin 
en|bought Hammerwood at auction with the hope of turning it into a music centre recording 
en|studio and flats Although the house did make an appearance at the beginning of the 
en|film The Song Remains the Same their plans did not progress Significant vandalism saw three 
en|tons of lead removed from the roof compromising it in fourteen different places and allowing 
en|thousands of gallons of water to leak into the structure The progression of the dry 
en|and wet rot accelerated leading the house to become increasingly structurally The house was subsequently 
en|boarded up in and put on sale in Having been for sale for four years 
en|the house was advertised in Country Life in June David Pinnegar a recently graduated physicist 
en|of years of age purchased the property – by this time in a very poor 
en|condition and including only c acres of overgrown gardens – in July with the intention 
en|of restoring and opening it to visitors Although there was some bemusement at his the 
en|house opened to the public in April and the restoration much of which was undertaken 
en|by won the Anne de Amodio award from IBI the International Burgen Institute now part

en|is located on the highest point of the Valsugana valley bottom at metres above sea 
en|level kilometres from Trento and about kilometres from Padua on the banks of the Rio 
en|Maggiore brook which is a tributary of Lake Levico from which originates the Brenta River 
en|The city is dominated by the mountains of the Lagorai range on the north with 
en|Monte Fronte elevation metres and Monte Panarotta metres and the zone of the Plateaus Vezzena 
en|Lavarone Luserna Folgaria on the south where Cima Vezzena also locally called Pizzo di Levico

en|the west the Vigolana range can be seen past the lakes of Levico and Caldonazzo 
en|and on the east the valley opens considerably and the view extends beyond Borgo Valsugana 
en|The urbanised area is predominantly on the valley floor with the main urban centre lying

en|Bene an AustroHungarian fort also known as Forte San Biagio from the name of the 
en|hill it is built on Traces of inhabitants in the Levico area can be dated 
en|back to the Iron Age though the first organised settlement springs up during the Roman 
en|era The etymology of the name "Levico" is still debated The major theories make Levico 
en|derive from Celtic terms such as leoug leak or lewa signifying "border postboundary marker" or 
en|from the barbaric gentilic Letta from which came Levi vicus then contracted into Levicus or 
en|from the Latin praedium Livicune "Livius' farm" then vulgarised into Lievigo and Levigo or Laevus 
en|vicus "village left of the river" The Latin interpretations are the ones most agreed with 
en|given the abundance of Latin terms in the topography of the municipality such as Furo

en|toponyms such as Guizza from wizza communal In the territory of Levico passed under the 
en|Bishopric of Trent established with Conrad II's donation to Bishop Ulrich II However Levico remained 
en|under the Diocese of Feltre regarding spiritual authority and would remain that way until The 
en|name Levico as Levigo appears for the first time in a document dated October in

en|Feltre in Valsugana Levico followed the history of the Bishopric and as communitas Levigi proclaimed 
en|its statute in and During the German Peasants' War in August peasants from the Valsugana 
en|marched towards Trento against the thenBishop's Captain; the rebellion however was rapidly crushed In and 
en|Levico was ravaged by plague epidemics; the latter cut the population in half In the 
en|century scientific journals spread news about the health effects of the local waters rich in 
en|arsenic and iron which were mentioned in Michelangelo Mariani's History of the Council of Trent 
en|in The first spa building taking advantage of these springs was opened in In through

en|the House of Habsburg Napoleon I on his way to the battle of Bassano in 
en|September after reaching Trento passed through the Valsugana encountering a light Austrian resistance in Levico 
en|which was then defined by Napoleon loco ameno et hospitale quaint and hospitable town Afterwards 
en|Levico would follow the rest of Trentino in its annexation to Austria after the abolition 
en|of the Bishopric as a political entity in The Third Italian War of Independence saw 
en|a battle between Austrian and Italian troops during the latter's advance towards Trento fought in 
en|town through the night between July and July In Levico was elevated to the rank 
en|of city Stadtgemeinde by ImperialRoyal Decree under Franz Joseph I of Austria and in it 
en|was reached by the Valsugana railway At the outbreak of World War I Levico was 
en|still part of AustriaHungary and as such it supplied a contingent of soldiers The Kaiserjäger 
en|Regiment had a battalion stationed in the city The civilian population though was mostly deported 
en|to internment camps Internierungslager in the heartland of the Empire when Italy joined the Entente 
en|on May The city lay indeed right next to the frontline of the plateaus to 
en|the south and most of the population ended up in camps in Moravia in the 
en|socalled wooden cities Those that mostly for being suspected of holding proItalian positions were deemed 
en|to pose a security risk were instead interned in Katzenau in harsh conditions The peace 
en|treaty assigned Levico along with the rest of Trentino and South Tyrol to Italy The 
en|city had been devastated by abandonment and the long absence of workers and reconstruction was

en|The Firm is a American legal thriller film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Tom

en|being The Pelican Brief Mitch McDeere about to graduate from Harvard Law School accepts a 
en|generous job offer from Bendini Lambert Locke a boutique firm in Memphis Tennessee Mitch and 
en|his wife Abby move to Memphis and he studies to pass the Tennessee bar exam 
en|Senior partner Avery Tolar mentors Mitch and introduces him to the firm's professional culture which 
en|demands strict loyalty confidentiality and a willingness to charge exceptional fees Mitch is seduced by 
en|the money and perks – including a house new car and his student loans paid 
en|off – but Abby is suspicious of the firm's interference with employees’ families Mitch passes 
en|the bar exam and begins working long hours straining his marriage Working closely with Avery 
en|Mitch learns that most of the firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide money in 
en|offshore shell corporations and other dubious taxavoidance schemes On a trip to the Cayman Islands 
en|Mitch hears a client state that the firm's Chicago clients break people's legs Seduced by 
en|a local woman Mitch cheats on Abby; this encounter was arranged by the firm's security 
en|chief Bill DeVasher who blackmails Mitch with photos of his tryst to keep him quiet 
en|about the firm's activities Learning that four of the firm’s associates died mysteriously Mitch hires 
en|private investigator Eddie Lomax who is shot dead which Lomax’s secretary Tammy witnesses Mitch is 
en|approached by FBI agents who reveal that BLL's biggest client is the Morolto Mafia family 
en|from Chicago Most of the firm is complicit in a massive tax fraud and money 
en|laundering scheme The dead associates had learned the truth and were killed on the firm’s 
en|orders as was Lomax The FBI warns Mitch that his house car and office are 
en|probably bugged and pressures him to provide evidence against the firm and the Moroltos Mitch 
en|agrees to cooperate in return for million and the release of his imprisoned brother Ray 
en|The FBI releases Ray planning to return him to prison once Mitch hands over the 
en|incriminating files and gives him half the money Mitch confesses his onenight stand in the 
en|Caymans to Abby who prepares to leave him When a client complains that he was 
en|billed for several hours of extra fees Mitch realizes that mailing clients these padded bills 
en|is mail fraud exposing the firm to RICO charges He secretly copies the firm's billing 
en|records with help from Tammy but needs files from Avery’s house in the Caymans Avery 
en|invites Abby to come with him to the Caymans and she declines but he reveals 
en|his work schedule has changed threatening Mitch's plans Telling Tammy not to inform Mitch Abby 
en|flies to the Caymans to seduce and drug Avery The firm's phone tap picks up 
en|Abby's warning to Tammy and DeVasher sends his hitmen to the Caymans After Abby and 
en|Tammy steal copy and return the files a drowsy Avery warns Abby to leave and 
en|is later found dead Mitch's plans are jeopardized when a prison guard on the Moroltos' 
en|payroll alerts DeVasher after Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities Evading 
en|DeVasher and his thugs Mitch meets with the Moroltos presenting himself as a loyal attorney 
en|looking out for his clients' interests He claims that his contact with the FBI and 
en|his copying of files were an attempt to expose the firm's illegal overbilling and asks 
en|the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices to help the FBI’s case 
en|against the firm Revealing that he has made his own copies he assures them that 
en|as long as he is alive any information he knows about their legal affairs is 
en|safe under attorneyclient privilege Guaranteeing Mitch's safety the Moroltos let him give the FBI the 
en|evidence it needs to prosecute the firm Since attorneyclient privilege does not apply when a 
en|lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity Mitch is able to continue his legal career and 
en|reconciles with Abby The film ends as the McDeeres return to Boston driving the same 
en|wellused car in which they arrived in Memphis Principal photography took place from November to 
en|March and though it was primarily filmed in Memphis Tennessee some scenes were filmed in 
en|Marion Arkansas and the Cayman Islands The film's soundtrack is almost exclusively solo piano by 
en|Dave Grusin Gene Hackman's name did not appear on the film's release poster Hackman joined 
en|the film late when it was already well into production because the producers had originally 
en|wanted to change the gender of the character and cast Meryl Streep until author John 
en|Grisham objected and Hackman was eventually cast Tom Cruise's deal with Paramount already stated that 
en|only his name could appear above the title Hackman also wanted his name to appear 
en|above the credits but when this was refused he asked for his name to be 
en|removed completely from the Hackman's name does appear in the beginning and end credits This 
en|is also the final film for Steven Hill and John Beal The film accords with 
en|the book in most respects but the ending is significantly different Mitch does not end 
en|up in the Caribbean as in the book; he and Abby simply get into their 
en|car and drive back to Boston as the ending narration "Do you think the car 
en|will make itto Boston" A more fundamental difference from the book is the motives and 
en|manner in which Mitch solves his predicament In the book Mitch acknowledges to himself that 
en|he is breaking the attorneyclient privilege by copying information and giving it to the FBI 
en|In most US states this privilege only applies to crimes that have already been committed 
en|The privilege does not apply if a lawyer knows that his client either is committing 
en|or will commit a crime However Mitch must disclose information about his legitimate clients as 
en|well Accepting that he will likely not be allowed to practice law anywhere again he 
en|swindles million from the Firm along with receiving million of a promised million from the 
en|FBI for his cooperation After an extended manhunt involving the police the firm's lawyers and 
en|hired thugs from the Morolto family Mitch escapes with Abby and his brother Ray to 
en|the Caymans Before fleeing he leaves behind detailed records of the firm's illegal activities as 
en|well as a recorded deposition Mitch's information gives federal prosecutors enough evidence to indict half 
en|of the Firm's active lawyers right away as well as several retired partners The documents 
en|also provide the FBI with circumstantial evidence of the Firm's involvement in money laundering and 
en|tax fraud and thus probable cause for a search warrant for the firm's building and 
en|files This additional evidence is enough to smash both the firm and the Morolto family 
en|with a massive RICO indictment In the film apparently in order to preserve the protagonist's 
en|personal integrity Mitch exposes a systematic overbilling scheme by the firm thus driving a wedge 
en|between the Moroltos who in essence become complicit with Mitch and their law firm in 
en|the book overbilling only received a brief mention He receives a smaller amount of money 
en|from the FBI which he gives to Ray allowing him to disappear Rather than capitalizing 
en|on his circumstances by stealing money from the Firm as in the book the movie's 
en|McDeere ends up battered and bruised but with his integrity and professional ethics intact Mitch 
en|also makes the FBI have to work in order to bring down the firm by 
en|having to argue that each instance of excessive billing is a federal offense by virtue 
en|of the excessive bills being sent through the mail The volume and frequency meet the 
en|criteria for RICO thereby enabling the FBI to effectively put the Firm out of business 
en|by seizing its property and equipment and freezing its bank accounts From here the Moroltos 
en|would then need to find another law firm willing to take them on as clients 
en|and if they couldn't charges for nonlodgment of tax returns could be brought Since Mitch 
en|is exposing only illegal activity he is able to retain his law license Instead of 
en|a BMW Mitch gets a MercedesBenz for joining the firm Avery Tolar was originally Avery 
en|Tolleson; the latest version of the novel uses the film's surname Tolar is portrayed as 
en|a sort of reluctant villain in the film while in the novel he has no 
en|such moral conflicts The surname of the second man killed on Grand Cayman is Joe 
en|Hodges instead of Hodge as in the novel Mitch's confession to Abby about his sexual 
en|infidelity was also unique to the film In the novel McDeere never tells Abby about 
en|his infidelity In the book Abby's not knowing about Mitch's infidelity is a major "suspense" 
en|piece Mitch comes home one evening and finds an envelope addressed to Abby that has 
en|"Photos – Do Not Bend" written on it The photos were surreptitiously given to DeVasher 
en|by Art Germain Mitch thinks it is the pictures he was shown of his infidelity 
en|overseas Abby is in the bedroom when he sees the open package He enters the 
en|bedroom and learns that Abby opened the package but it was empty Mitch realizes DeVasher 
en|is toying with him and this incident in the book causes Mitch to cooperate with 
en|the FBI In the film Mitch's confession prompts Abby to seriously consider leaving him but 
en|she ultimately helps him bring down the firm Also in the book Eddie's old secretary 
en|Tammy seduces and drugs Avery In the movie however it is Abby who seduces Avery 
en|This also changes the character development because in the movie Abby is portrayed as risking 
en|herself for Mitch In the book Abby is simply an accomplice to Tammy In the 
en|novel a dirty FBI agent betrays McDeere to let the firm know about the deal 
en|In the movie a prison guard alerts the firm to Ray McDeere's release alerting them 
en|that Mitch McDeere cut a deal with the FBI Critical reaction to The Firm has 
en|been mostly positive with the film earning a rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on Audiences 
en|polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to 
en|F Roger Ebert gave The Firm three stars out of four remarking "The movie is 
en|virtually an anthology of good small character performances The large gallery of characters makes The 
en|Firm into a convincing canvas but with a screenplay that developed the story more clearly 
en|this might have been a superior movie instead of just a good one with some 
en|fine The film earned some negative reviews as well notably from James Berardinelli who said 
en|that "very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated 
en|to the screen and what we're left with instead is an overlylong and pedantic Grisham 
en|enjoyed the film remarking "I thought Tom Cruise did a good job He played the 
en|innocent young associate very The film was released while Grisham was at the height of 
en|his popularity That week Grisham and Michael Crichton evenly divided the top six paperback spots

en|In art history a notname German ˈnoːtˌnaːmə listen "necessityname" or "contingencyname" is an invented name 
en|given to an artist whose identity has been lost The practice arose from the need 
en|to give such artists and their typically untitled or generically titled works an acceptable if 
en|unsatisfactory grouping avoiding confusion when cataloging The phrases provisional name name of convenience and emergency 
en|names are sometimes used to describe anonymous masters; nonce name was at one time used 
en|The practice of using generic names for unidentified artists is most common in the study 
en|of art of the antiquity especially of the Roman era or with artists of the 
en|Northern Renaissance until about Typically a pseudonym is applied after commonality is established for a 
en|grouping of works of which a similarity of theme style iconography biblical source or physical 
en|location can probably be attributed to one individual or workshop but because of lack of 
en|surviving documentary record the name of that individual is lost Groupings of works under a 
en|given notname can often be contentious; in specific cases art historians have argued that the 
en|reality may be a group or school of artists working under a common influence or 
en|commercial demand Linking a generically titled old master with a historical person is usually a 
en|tempting and exciting prospect and would establish an art historian's reputation The given notname usually 
en|depends on the artist's location the most distinctive feature of their work or the theme 
en|or iconographic element they are best associated with Some notnames created based on a single 
en|artwork called namepiece Well known examples include the Master of the Embroidered Foliage active c 
en|to c so named after his distinctive way of painting grass and the Master of 
en|the Life of the Virgin active c to c and the Master of the Legend 
en|of the Magdalen active c – c both named after scenes from the Life of 
en|the Virgin attributed to them the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi active 
en|c – named after his most famous panel and the Vienna Master of Mary of 
en|Burgundy c – c named after a manuscript owned by one of his The Berlin 
en|Painter active c BCE was named by Sir John Beazley for a large lidded amphora 
en|in the Antikensammlung Berlin the Berlin Painter's In the case of and early Netherlandish French 
en|and German painters and illuminators the problem is particularly acute and stems from a number 
en|of factors Primarily the practice of signing and dating works is rarely seen in the 
en|region until the and the inventories of collectors were uninterested in the artist's Many of 
en|the unidentified late and early northern artists were of the first rank but because they 
en|have not been attached to any historical person have suffered from academic neglect It is 
en|probably a truism to say that as Susie Nash put it "much of what cannot 
en|be firmly attributed remains less Some art historians believe that this has led to a 
en|lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons and that such connections often hang 
en|on thin threads of circumstantial evidence The identities of a number of wellknown artists have 
en|been founded on the basis of a single signed documented or otherwise attributed work with 
en|similar works sharing close style or within a geographical range also attached to that name

en|normally achieved within a master's degree program The design implementation and manufacturing were carried out 
en|by students with only two exceptions the manufacturing of the mechanical structure carried out by

en|was to find out if it was possible to receive AIS signals from a CubeSat

en|in the first pure Danish research satellite Ørsted which was successfully launched in predecessors were 
en|AAU CubeSat launched and AAUSATII launched Students from AAU also participated in SSETI EXPRESS launched 
en|a student satellite initiative by ESA Education The construction of began in was launched on 
en|February on PSLV Operations were a success AIS messages were received on a daily basis 
en|and downloaded to the mission control center MCC located in Aalborg Denmark All subsystems were 
en|tested and running The first days of operation were very successful No degradation of the 
en|satellite was observed all subsystems were working and the primary payload – an AIS receiver 
en|– was working correctly The mission continued Two critical situations occurred during the first days 
en|February The last message for some days was received During the previous hours battery voltage 
en|was decreasing and temperature readings indicated that was steady pointing the side without solar cells 
en|towards the sun During the last pass over Aalborg it was observed that battery voltage 
en|was slowly decreasing The situation was discussed and analyzed during the day and it was 
en|decided to instruct on all upcoming passes to switch off beacon mode because it was 
en|using power No further attempt was taken to make contact during the weekend in order 
en|to preserve and recharge the satellite's battery All passes were supervised There was total silence 
en|until March at where the ground station in Aalborg requestes and received a beacon The 
en|beacon showed an uptime of day hours that everything was working and that more than 
en|AIS messages had been received Everything went back to normal The requested beacon also showed 
en|a high number of reboots possibly due to low battery voltage Due to this event 
en|was set to tumble slowly – rotations for every orbit – to avoid a repetition 
en|of the problem May The power system EPS on rejected multiframe communication packages from the 
en|ground During four passes minutes the students analyzed the situation and inspected the C source 
en|for the EPS server and a solution was found A new package was sent to 
en|and normal EPS operation was reestablished During the event the rest of the satellite – 
en|due to the decentralized design – was working During the first days close to AIS 
en|packages were received and downloaded June Two new software images for the SDR AIS receiver 
en|were uploaded It took approximately paths to upload a full AIS receiver image The satellite 
en|showed improvement and was newly capable of sampling and decoding in real time First metrics 
en|showed a capacity of around AIS messages per hour on average February One year up 
en|in space was fully functioning and AIS measurements were done on a regular basis A 
en|ground station was established at Thule Qaanaaq Greenland for extended download capacity Energy production was 
en|stable but low so the mission was interleaved with hours or days for charging batteries 
en|New uploaded algorithms showed reception of approximately messages per hour and realtime performance which meant 
en|that decoding took less time than sampling and was carried out in parallel Due to 
en|the ground station at Thule it was possible to carry out realtime supervision measuring and 
en|downloading at the same time So only a few seconds after detection the information was 
en|available in Aalborg at the MCC September The last message was received from the satellite 
en|was based on a decentralized concept with no dedicated master The idea behind this approach 
en|was to achieve a modular satellite that in many cases would be able to function 
en|even when certain subsystems failed For that reason the musthave subsystems EPS and COM were 
en|designed to be simple and robust whereas subsystems like were by necessity more complex with 
en|a concomitant higher failure rate The power system EPS acts as intelligent supervisor and watchdog 
en|consists of several subsystems On the ground segment there were All internal and satellitetoground communication

en|Intrinsic safety IS is a protection technique for safe operation of electrical equipment in hazardous 
en|areas by limiting the energy electrical and thermal available for ignition In signal and control 
en|circuits that can operate with low currents and voltages the intrinsic safety approach simplifies circuits 
en|and reduces installation cost over other protection methods Areas with dangerous concentrations of flammable gases 
en|or dust are found in applications such as petrochemical refineries and mines As a discipline 
en|it is an application of inherent safety in instrumentation Highpower circuits such as electric motors 
en|or lighting cannot use intrinsic safety methods for protection In normal use electrical equipment often 
en|creates tiny electric arcs internal sparks in switches motor brushes connectors and in other places 
en|Compact electrical equipment generates heat as well which under some circumstances can become an ignition 
en|source There are multiple ways to make equipment safe for use in explosivehazardous areas Intrinsic 
en|safety denoted by "i" in the ATEX and IECEx Explosion Classifications is one of several 
en|available methods for electrical equipment Others include explosion proof NEC or flameproof enclosures "d" in 
en|IEC ATEX and NEC increased safety "e" encapsulation "m" enclosedbreak device "nC" sealed device "nC" 
en|hermeticallysealed device "nC" restrictedbreathing enclosure "nR" oil immersion "o" protection of optical radiation "op" venting 
en|"p" powder or sand filling "q" special protection "s" and dust ignition protection by enclosure 
en|"t" For handheld electronics intrinsic safety is the only realistic method that allows a functional 
en|device to be explosion protected A device termed intrinsically safe is designed to be incapable 
en|of producing heat or spark sufficient to ignite an explosive atmosphere even if the device 
en|has experienced deterioration or has been damaged There are several considerations in designing intrinsically safe 
en|electronics devices reducing or eliminating internal sparking controlling component temperatures and eliminating component spacing that 
en|would allow dust to short a circuit Elimination of spark potential within components is accomplished 
en|by limiting the available energy in any given circuit and the system as a whole 
en|Temperature under certain fault conditions such as an internal short in a semiconductor device becomes 
en|an issue as the temperature of a component can rise to a level that can 
en|ignite some explosive gasses even in normal use Safeguards such as current limiting by resistors 
en|and fuses must be employed to ensure that in no circumstance can a component reach 
en|a temperature that could cause autoignition of a combustible atmosphere In the highly compact electronic 
en|devices used today PCBs often have component spacing that create the possibility of an arc 
en|between components if dust or other particulate matter works into the circuitry thus component spacing 
en|siting and isolation become important to the design The primary concept behind intrinsic safety is 
en|the restriction of available electrical and thermal energy in the system so that ignition of 
en|a hazardous atmosphere explosive gas or dust cannot occur This is achieved by ensuring that 
en|only low voltages and currents enter the hazardous area and that no significant energy storage 
en|is possible One of the most common methods for protection is to limit electric current 
en|by using series resistors using types of resistors that always fail open; and limit the 
en|voltage with multiple zener diodes In zener barriers dangerous incoming potentials are grounded with galvanic 
en|isolation barriers there is no direct connection between the safe and hazardousarea circuits by interposing 
en|a layer of insulation between the two Certification standards for intrinsic safety designs mainly IEC 
en|but since also IEC TS generally require that the barrier do not exceed approved levels 
en|of voltage and current with specified damage to limiting components Equipment or instrumentation for use 
en|in a hazardous area will be designed to operate with low voltage and current and 
en|will be designed without any large capacitors or inductors that could discharge in a spark 
en|The instrument will be connected using approved wiring methods back to a control panel in 
en|a nonhazardous area that contains safety barriers The safety barriers ensure that in normal operation 
en|and with the application of faults according to the Equipment Protection Level EPL also if 
en|accidental contact occurs between the instrument circuit and other power sources no more than the 
en|approved voltage and current enters the hazardous area For example during marine transfer operations when 
en|flammable products are transferred between the marine terminal and tanker ships or barges twoway radio 
en|communication needs to be constantly maintained in case the transfer needs to stop for unforeseen 
en|reasons such as a spill The United States Coast Guard requires that the two way 
en|radio must be certified as intrinsically safe Another example is intrinsically safe or explosionproof mobile 
en|phones used in explosive atmospheres such as refineries Intrinsically safe mobile phones must meet special 
en|battery design criteria in order to achieve UL ATEX directive or IECEx certification for use 
en|in explosive atmospheres Only properly designed batteryoperated selfcontained devices can be intrinsically safe by themselves 
en|Other field devices and wiring are intrinsically safe only when employed in a properly designed 
en|IS system Such systems shall be designed and documented according to the standard IEC Intrinsically 
en|safe electrical systems installed according to IEC and inspected and maintained according to IEC Standards 
en|for intrinsic protection are mainly developed by IECInternational Electrotechnical Commission but different agencies also develop 
en|standards for intrinsic safety Agencies may be run by governments or may be composed of 
en|members from insurance companies manufacturers and industries with an interest in safety standards Certifying agencies 
en|allow manufacturers to affix a label or mark to identify that the equipment has been 
en|designed to the relevant product safety standards Examples of such agencies in North America are 
en|the Factory Mutual Research Corporation which certifies radios Underwriters Laboratories UL that certifies mobile phones 
en|and in Canada the Canadian Standards In the EU the standard for intrinsic safety certification 
en|is the CENELEC standard EN and shall be certified according to the ATEX directive while 
en|in other countries around the world the IEC standards are followed To facilitate world trade 
en|standards agencies around the world engage in harmonization activity so that intrinsically safe equipment manufactured 
en|in one country eventually might be approved for use in another without redundant expensive testing

en|theft Profaci's sons were Frank Profaci and John Profaci Sr Frank eventually joined the Profaci 
en|crime family while John Sr followed legitimate Two of Profaci's daughters married the sons of 
en|Detroit Partnership mobsters William Tocco and Joseph Profaci's brother was Salvatore Profaci who served as 
en|his consigliere for years and is known to have been heavily into dealing of pornographic 
en|materials One of Profaci's brothersinlaw was Joseph Magliocco who would eventually become Profaci's underboss Profaci's 
en|niece Rosalie Profaci was married to Salvatore Bonanno the son of Bonanno crime family boss 
en|Joseph Bonanno Profaci was the uncle of Salvatore Profaci Jr also a member of the 
en|Profaci crime Rosalie Profaci offered the following description of her uncle He was a flamboyant 
en|man who smoked big cigars drove big black Cadillacs and did things like buy tickets 
en|to a Broadway play for us cousins But he didn't buy two or three or 
en|even four seats he bought a whole Released from prison in Profaci emigrated to the 
en|United States arriving in New York City on September Profaci settled in Chicago where he 
en|opened a grocery store and bakery However the business was unsuccessful and in Profaci relocated 
en|to New York where he entered the olive oil import On September Profaci became a 
en|United States At some point after his move to Brooklyn Profaci became involved with local 
en|gangs On December Profaci attended a mob meeting in Cleveland Ohio that would make him 
en|an organized crime boss in Brooklyn In October Brooklyn boss Salvatore D'Aquila was murdered An 
en|important part of the Cleveland meeting attended by mobsters from Tampa Florida Chicago and Brooklyn 
en|was to appoint Profaci as Aquila's replacement so as to maintain calm among the Brooklyn 
en|Magliocco was named as Profaci's secondincommand Given Profaci's lack of experience in organized crime it 
en|is unclear why the New York gangs gave him power in Brooklyn Some speculated that 
en|Profaci received this position due to his family's status in Sicily where they may have 
en|belonged to the Villabate Mafia Profaci may have also benefited from contacts made through his 
en|olive oil Cleveland police eventually raided the meeting and expelled the mobsters from Cleveland but 
en|Profaci's business was accomplished By Profaci was controlling numbers prostitution loansharking and narcotics trafficking in 
en|Brooklyn In the Castellammarese War broke out in New York City Some sources say that 
en|Profaci remained neutral while others say that Profaci was firmly aligned with Castellammarese boss Salvatore 
en|When the war finally ended in top mobster Charles "Lucky" Luciano reorganized the New York 
en|gangs into five organized crime families At this point Profaci was recognized as boss of 
en|what was now the Profaci crime family with Magliocco as underboss and Salvatore Profaci as 
en|consigliere When Luciano created the National Crime Syndicate also known as the Mafia Commission he 
en|gave Profaci a seat on the governing board Profaci's closest ally on the board was 
en|Bonanno who would cooperate with Profaci over the next years Profaci was also allied with 
en|Stefano Magaddino the boss of the Buffalo crime family Profaci obtained most of his wealth 
en|through traditional illegal enterprises such as protection rackets and extortion However to protect himself from 
en|federal tax evasion charges Profaci still maintained his original olive oil business known as Mamma 
en|Mia Importing Company leading to his nickname as "Olive Oil As the demand for olive 
en|oil skyrocketed after World War II his business thrived Profaci owned other businesses that employed 
en|hundreds of workers in New Profaci owned a large house in Bensonhurst Brooklyn a home 
en|in Miami Beach Florida and an estate near Hightstown New Jersey which previously belonged to 
en|President Theodore Roosevelt Profaci's estate had its own airstrip and a chapel with an altar 
en|that replicated one in St Peter's Basilica in Profaci was a devout Catholic who made 
en|generous cash donations to Catholic charities A member of the Knights of Columbus Profaci would 
en|invite priests to his estate to celebrate Mass In May a thief stole valuable jeweled 
en|crowns from the Regina Pacis Votive shrine in Brooklyn Profaci sent his men to recover 
en|the crowns and reportedly kill the thief However accounts of the thief being strangled with 
en|a rosary are In the Vatican received a petition from a group of New York 
en|Catholics to confer a knighthood on Profaci However when the Brooklyn District Attorney complained about 
en|the move the Vatican denied the In the US Internal Revenue Service sued Profaci for 
en|over million in unpaid income The taxes were still unpaid when Profaci died nine years 
en|In the US Department of Justice moved to revoke Profaci's citizenship The government claimed that 
en|when Profaci entered the United States in he lied to immigration officials about having no 
en|arrest record in Italy In a US Court of Appeals reversed Profaci's deportation order ending 
en|the legal In law enforcement recorded a phone conversation between Profaci and Antonio Cottone a 
en|Sicilian mafioso about exporting Sicilian oranges to the United States In US Customs agents intercepted 
en|one of those orange crates in New York The crate contained wax oranges containing a 
en|total pounds of pure heroin Smugglers in Sicily had filled the hollow oranges with heroin 
en|until they weighed as much as real oranges then packed them in the Profaci was 
en|never prosecuted for this crime In Profaci attended the Apalachin Conference a national mob meeting 
en|at the farm of mobster Joseph Barbara in Apalachin New York While the conference was 
en|in progress New York State Troopers surrounded the farm and raided it Profaci was one 
en|of over mobsters arrested that day On January Profaci and others were convicted of conspiracy 
en|and he was sentenced to five years in prison However on November a United States 
en|Court of Appeals overturned the In contrast to Profaci's generosity to his relatives and the 
en|church many of his soldati considered him miserly and mean with money One reason for 
en|their rancor was that Profaci required each family member to pay him a a month 
en|tithe an old Sicilian gang custom The money which amounted to approximately a month was 
en|meant to support the families of mobsters in prison However most of this money stayed 
en|with Profaci In addition Profaci did not tolerate any dissent from his policies People who 
en|expressed discontent were On February the Gallos led by Joe Gallo kidnapped four of Profaci's 
en|top men underboss Magliocco Frank Profaci Joe Profaci's brother capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John 
en|Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in While holding the hostages Larry and 
en|Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme 
en|for the hostages' release Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand before negotiations but 
en|his brother Larry overruled him After a few weeks of negotiation Profaci made a deal 
en|with the Profaci's consigliere Charles "the Sidge" LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the 
en|hostages were released However Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement On August 
en|Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph "Joe Jelly" Gioielli and Larry Gallo 
en|Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioilli after inviting him to go Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt 
en|in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore "Sally" D'Ambrosio after 
en|a police officer The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and 
en|his The Gallos then began calling Persico "The Snake" after he had betrayed the war 
en|continued on resulting in nine murders and three With the start of the gang war 
en|the Gallo crew retreated to the By Profaci's health was failing In early Carlo Gambino 
en|and Lucchese crime family boss Tommy Lucchese tried to convince Profaci to resign to end 
en|the gang war However Profaci strongly suspected that the two bosses were secretly supporting the 
en|Gallo brothers and wanted to take control of his family Profaci vehemently refused to resign; 
en|furthermore he warned that any attempt to remove him would spark a wider gang war 
en|Gambino and Lucchese did not pursue their On June Profaci died in South Side Hospital 
en|in Bay Shore New York of liver He is buried at Saint John Cemetery in 
en|the Middle Village section of Queens in one of the largest mausoleums in the After 
en|Profaci's death Magliocco succeeded him as head of the In late the Mafia Commission forced

en|The fire triangle or combustion triangle is a simple model for understanding the necessary ingredients 
en|for most The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite heat fuel 
en|and an oxidizing agent usually A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and 
en|combined in the right meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing 
en|A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in 
en|the fire triangle For example covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen 
en|part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire In large fires where firefighters are 
en|called in decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is 
en|no effective way to make that happen in an extended The fire tetrahedron represents the 
en|addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction to the three already present in 
en|the fire triangle Once a fire has started the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the 
en|fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements 
en|of the fire is blocked Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen 
en|it needs Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the 
en|ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel Halon can be used to remove 
en|free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the 
en|chemical reaction responsible for the Combustion is the chemical reaction that feeds a fire more 
en|heat and allows it to continue When the fire involves burning metals like lithium magnesium 
en|etc known as a classD fire it becomes even more important to consider the energy 
en|release The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is 
en|released Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even 
en|exploding Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as Therefore inert agents eg 
en|dry sand must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion In the 
en|same way as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is removed 
en|combustion stops The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction In most cases 
en|it is the ambient air and in particular one of its components oxygen By depriving 
en|a fire of air it can be extinguished; for example when covering the flame of 
en|a small candle with an empty glass fire stops; to the contrary if air is 
en|blown over a wood fire with bellows the fire is activated by the introduction of 
en|more air Some chemicals such as fluorine gas perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate or 
en|chlorine trifluoride act as oxidisers sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself A fire based 
en|on a reaction with these oxidisers can be very difficult to put out until the 
en|oxidiser is exhausted; that leg of the fire triangle cannot be broken by normal means 
en|ie depriving it of air will not smother it In certain cases such as some 
en|explosives the oxidizer and combustible are the same eg nitroglycerin an unstable molecule that has 
en|oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts Reaction is initiated by an 
en|activating energy in most cases it is heat Several examples include friction as in case 
en|of matches heating an electrical wire a flame propagation of fire or a spark from 
en|a lighter or from any starting electrical device There are also many other ways to 
en|bring sufficient activation energy including electricity radiation and pressure all of which will lead to 
en|a temperature rise In most cases heat production enables selfsustainability of the reaction and enables 
en|a chain reaction to grow The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to 
en|get a flammable mix with selfsustainable combustion is called its flashpoint To stop a combustion 
en|reaction one of the three elements of the firetriangle has to be removed Without sufficient 
en|heat a fire cannot begin and it cannot continue Heat can be removed by the 
en|application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction 
en|This is often water which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam Introducing 
en|sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of 
en|heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner Scraping embers from a burning 
en|structure also removes the heat source Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes 
en|the ignition source Without fuel a fire will stop Fuel can be removed naturally as 
en|where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel or manually by mechanically or chemically 
en|removing the fuel from the fire Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire 
en|suppression and is the basis for most major tactics such as controlled burns The fire 
en|stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease 
en|in energy release and a lower temperature Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat Without 
en|sufficient oxygen a fire cannot begin and it cannot continue With a decreased oxygen concentration 
en|the combustion process slows Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide 
en|fire extinguisher a fire blanket or water Water can have two different roles In the 
en|case of a solid combustible the solid fuel produces pyrolyzing products under the influence of 
en|heat commonly radiation This process is halted by the application of water since water is 
en|more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed Thereby energy is removed from the fuel 
en|surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped removing the fuel supply to 
en|the flames In fire fighting this is referred to as surface cooling In the gas 
en|phase ie in the flames or in the smoke the combustible can not be separated 
en|from the oxidizer and the only possible action consists of cooling down In this case 
en|water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase thereby lowering the temperature and adding water 
en|vapour making the gas mixture non combustible This requires droplets of a size less than 
en|about In fire fighting this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling Cases 
en|also exist where the ignition factor is not the activation energy For example a smoke 
en|explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by 
en|a sudden fresh air input oxidizer input The interval in which an airgas mix can 
en|burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air This interval can be very 
en|small kerosene or large acetylene Water cannot be used on certain type of fires Since 
en|these reactions are well understood it has been possible to create specific wateradditives which will 
en|allow Wateradditives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires class A 
en|+ class B or even class A + class B + class F meaning a 
en|better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires 
en|or fires that involve several different classes of materials In the context of wildland fire 
en|the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to understand fire spread over landscapes 
en|scales of days and several km and recurrence of fire over time scales of decades 
en|and hundreds of Thus while heat is important to ignite a flame topography is important 
en|for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels and ignitions sources are important to 
en|help explain recurrence on longer time scales Similarly while oxygen is relevant to sustain a 
en|flame weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire and the longerterm pattern 
en|of weather is summarized as climate Lastly fuels is the term to describe what burns 
en|in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire but 
en|fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation At the 
en|smallest scale the combustion fire triangle individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical 
en|temperature and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings Combustion events range on the scale 
en|of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the 
en|quadrant scale The largest scale in contrast describes the fire regime concept Global climate change 
en|drives many of the factors involved in the 'wildfire' and the 'fire regime' triangles For 
en|example with respect to the fire regime a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic 
en|fire in terms of recurrence intensity seasonality and biological effects; a change in vegetation type

en|corner of the Rosedale neighbourhood of Toronto Ontario Canada It is located on the east 
en|side of Yonge Street adjacent to the neighbourhood of Summerhill and a short distance south 
en|of the Summerhill TTC subway station It is now home to a Liquor Control Board 
en|of Ontario LCBO liquor store The station constructed in the Beaux Arts tradition consists of 
en|a clock tower and a threestorey main terminal The tower is modelled after the Campanile 
en|di San Marco in Saint Mark's Square in Venice The main terminal gallery has an 
en|high ceiling supported by marble walls and with elegant bronze suspended light fixtures The foot 
en|print of the station is feet inches by feet inches and that of the clock 
en|tower is feet inches according to plans published in the August edition of Canadian Railway 
en|and Marine World The North Toronto Station was the first building in the city to 
en|be constructed of Tyndall limestone from Manitoba supplied by The Wallace Sandstone Quarries The material 
en|is noted for its weather resistance embedded fossils and dappled beige hues The four clock 
en|faces each metres in diameter were always illuminated at night during the station's service life 
en|The station was designed by Darling and Pearson and built in by P Lyall Sons 
en|Construction Company to service the Canadian Pacific Railway CPR line running across Toronto The cornerstone 
en|was laid on September by Mayor Tommy Church and the station officially opened for passenger 
en|service on June though it had already been serving in the role since June The 
en|station was built at a cost of in The current structure replaced a more modest 
en|railway station to the west of Yonge The two structures existed together for a time

en|Station opened in and the Great Depression followed shortly thereafter the North Toronto Station which 
en|served smaller towns in Ontario and was originally meant to augment the bigger station began 
en|to suffer The last paying passengers filed through the station on September Brewers' Retail moved 
en|into the northern portion of the terminal building in The station was reopened briefly at 
en|on May when King George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth mother of Queen Elizabeth 
en|II arrived for their first visit to Toronto This was the "first visit to Canada 
en|by a reigning British The king was also officially a Canadian monarch marking the first 
en|visit by one to the city The couple departed Toronto through Union Station Shortly after 
en|World War II returning soldiers passed through the station; they were its last rail passengers 
en|On September a time capsule was entombed in the tonnes cornerstone laid by the then 
en|mayor of Toronto Tommy Church The capsule was found and opened years later in September 
en|It contained around items including blueprints an old map of Toronto six newspapers from September 
en|coins and a City of Toronto municipal handbook The items were found in exceptional condition 
en|with only yellowing pages on the newspapers and tarnish on the coins A new capsule 
en|was buried in the space occupied by the former that included items from September issues 
en|of the Toronto Star The Globe and Mail and National Post a copy of the 
en|September issue of Toronto Life magazine and the current edition of the LCBO Food Drink 
en|guide were included Also buried were a BlackBerry and an iPhone a modern map of 
en|Toronto and a few bottles of spirits in homage to the current use of the 
en|building as an LCBO Though the former beauty of the station's exterior could be surmised 
en|even in its most downtrodden days much of the station's elegant interior was hidden behind 
en|boardings put up by Brewers' Retail and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario LCBO the 
en|governmentowned alcohol retailer which had moved into the southern part of the terminal building in 
en|until the building was restored in by Woodcliffe Corporation The architects were Goldsmith Borgal Company 
en|Ltd Architects and Eastern Construction was contracted to do the work The clocks had been 
en|removed from the tower between and allowing pigeons to enter the structure through holes in 
en|the clock faces The first order of business during the restoration of the tower was 
en|the removal of approximately kilograms of desiccated pigeon droppings that had accumulated in its base 
en|The original movements of the clocks themselves were almost completely recovered and restored; now with 
en|the help of GPS signals they display the time with much greater precision and reliability 
en|The building is protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since October The 
en|building was a former Heritage Railway Station but was removed from the list of protected 
en|stations as a railway no longer owned the property A Heritage Easement has been placed 
en|on the property since December The City of Toronto also lists the building as part 
en|of the South Rosedale Heritage Conservation Though it now serves as the Summerhill LCBO outlet

en|the concrete floor was impregnated with rubber from discarded automobile tires A Piazza called Scrivener 
en|Square named in honour of Margaret Scrivener with a tipping water fountain provides a wide 
en|public space on the southern aspect In the GO Transit first proposed reintroducing passenger service 
en|for commuters through North Toronto station in the form of a ‘Midtown’ line allowing commuter 
en|traffic to run between the existing Kipling and Agincourt stations without travelling through the city 
en|centre A new transit plan announced by Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty in included a proposal 
en|to institute a Midtown corridor and this was repeated by Metrolinx in their regional transportation 
en|plan The Big Move In addition it has been suggestedby whom that the station could 
en|be used for some Via Rail and Ontario Northland trains in order to relieve congestion 
en|at Union Station or as a branch of a future cityairport rail link The original 
en|building measured feet inches by feet inches with a midway and baggage room built under 
en|the tracks that measured feet inches by feet inch and clock tower was feet inches 
en|The clock tower stands feet tall and estimating from the photographs the main building is 
en|about feet high Once entered the building only has one floor with the rails elevated 
en|by an embankment that allows passage underneath without having to change floors Additions in added 
en|a triangular section to the north side of the building that includes more retail space 
en|and a loading dock pushing the west façade tight to the side walk bordering Yonge 
en|Street and also extending the eastern side of the building to include another loading dock 
en|The scale is quite grand and is apparent by the foot high ceiling as one 
en|enters into what once was the main waiting area The public areas are at a 
en|large scale that tapers once one circulates to the midway under the tracks and would 
en|have opened up again once one were to move up to the platform because at 
en|the time of construction the embankment built for the tracks would have been one of 
en|the higher points in the vicinity The choice of materials is quite monochromatic from the 
en|beige Tyndall limestone from Manitoba the beige brown and green marble throughout the interior and 
en|light brown terrazzo for the flooring There are only a few variations from this palette 
en|and are made to be very meaningful They are the ornate white plaster ceilings of 
en|the waiting room and green copper spire of the clock tower Even the steel used 
en|for the overpass and the covered area outside are of a similar palette The building 
en|is very approachable because of the materials chosen They work well on the large scale 
en|to give the building weight and solidity but as one more closely inspects the materiality 
en|the scale will change with the slight rustication of the limestone showing fossil evidence and 
en|the veining of the marble unique in every square foot The station can be broken 
en|down into three main areas the main building encompassing the waiting room ticket office and 
en|concourse; the clock tower; and the area underneath the tracks that include the midway and 
en|baggage area leading up to the platforms The breaking down of components into 'threes' figures 
en|heavily in the building from three separate programmatic elements to the main building being broken 
en|down into three sections Having the elevation drop on either side to give it an 
en|ABA rhythm breaks the main building into three and the groupings go further There are 
en|three very large arched windows with the main entrance set at ground level in the 
en|center At ground level there is also a grouping of three smaller windows set to 
en|either side of the entrance under the large arched windows as well as a grouping 
en|the same size to either side Vertically the elevation is also broken into three main 
en|components the ground level which is given a human scale with the overhang and included 
en|smaller windows and entrance; the second level is the tallest and includes three large arched 
en|windows; and the third grouping a relatively simple frieze cornice and parapet The plaster ceiling 
en|in the waiting room is also broken into three sections by two large beams and 
en|unity is drawn from outside to inside by the dentil detail in the plaster and 
en|on the cornice The interior also follows the same hierarchy as the exterior by having 
en|changes in the wall treatments The marble makes a break at what seems to be 
en|traditional ceiling height to give the retail space a human scale while the rest of 
en|walls are pure marble all the way the ceiling which makes the third part The 
en|concourse which is still in the main building but acts as a transition to the 
en|area underneath the tracks has a vaulted ceiling broken in the three separate elements The 
en|clock tower also follows this rule of threes In elevation it has a heavy robust 
en|base that is taller than the rest of the building This is topped with another 
en|section that is more ornate yet lighter detailed with two columns to make three bays 
en|and finally the actual clock and roof The clock tower is modeled after the Campanile 
en|of St Mark's in Venice which had collapsed and was being rebuilt shortly before the 
en|construction of the station It is an interesting effect of the tower getting lighter with 
en|higher elevation The bottom tier is mostly stone with only a vertical line of very 
en|narrow fenestration The second tier becomes much lighter with the intercolumnation and having the stone 
en|wall set a distance behind the columns to give it the depth needed to create 
en|a sense of openness The third tier completes the lightness by becoming narrower and employing

en|In computing fragmented objects are truly distributed objects It is a novel design principle extending 
en|the traditional concept of stub based distribution In contrast to distributed objects they are physically 
en|distributed and encapsulate the distribution in the object itself Parts of the object named fragments 
en|may exist on different nodes and provide the object's interface Each client accessing a fragmented 
en|object by its unique object identity presumes a local fragment Fragmented objects may act like 
en|a RPCbased infrastructure or a caching smart proxy as well Therefore clients cannot distinguish between 
en|the access of a local object a local stub or a local fragment Full transparency 
en|is gained by the following characteristics of fragmented objects Arbitrary protocols may be chosen for 
en|the internal communication between the fragments For instance this allows to hide realtime protocols eg 
en|RTP for media streaming behind a standard CORBA interface The internal structure of a fragmented 
en|object is arranged by the object developerdeployer It may be client–server hierarchical peertopeer and others 
en|Thus a downward compatibility to stub based distribution is ensured As both the distribution of 
en|state and functionality are hidden behind the object interface their respective distribution over the fragments 
en|is also arbitrary In addition an application using a fragmented object can also tolerate a 
en|change in distributions which is achieved by exchanging the fragment at one or multiple hosts 
en|This procedure can either be triggered by a user who changes object properties or by 
en|the fragmented object itself that is the collectivity of its fragments eg when some fragment 
en|is considered to have failed Of course an exchange request may trigger one or more 
en|other internal changes The object developer can migrate the state and the functionality over the

en|in aircraft design and then as a microprocessor scientist at Sperry Gyroscope at Bristol United 
en|Kingdom He received a from his wife for his thirtyseventh birthday in Malcolm developed basic 
en|aspects of the game to test what the computer was capable of and completed it 
en|after adding design features suggested by JKGreye including adding the TRex and turning the Maze 
en|into a game Friends persuaded Malcolm that the game was of high enough quality to 
en|sell and it was eventually released by JK Greye Software in February When soon after that 
en|the Bristol branch of Sperry Gyroscope closed Malcolm made a decision to concentrate fully on 
en|computer gaming The firm New Generation Software he had founded kept producing games for the 
en|Sinclair Research computers and became synonymous with gaming on this platform for some Some of 
en|his games were hailed by the gaming scene but some titles occasionally drew criticism from 
en|reviewers for their fancy graphics but poor game plot After releasing Defender and Breakout for 
en|the Malcolm switched the development efforts from to ZX Spectrum as the latter model hit 
en|the market In addition to republishing the Monster Maze the new firm also released such 
en|game titles as Escape Tunnel Knot in Corridors of Genon Trashman and Travel with Trashman 
en|Light Magic Jonah Barrington's Squash The Custard Kid and Cliff The game was sold domestically 
en|in the UK and overseas and became a hit shortly after it was released when 
en|the had just been launched software standards were generally pretty low One exception to this 
en|rule was a program called Monster Maze which has been a firm favourite with owners 
en|since it first appeared Contemporary reviews described it as "the best game I have seen 
en|for the Sinclair and "Brilliant brilliant brilliant Straight away this gets into my personal top 
en|ten ZX Programs Undoubtedly one of the best ZX programs Even though it did not 
en|use the undocumented hires graphics feature of the and rendered the scene with pseudographics characters

en|utilising the machine's capabilities to its best If I had to choose just one programme 
en|to impress an audience with the capabilities of the then Monster Maze would be the 
en|one without a doubt Soon the Sinclair platform users began switching over to the newer 
en|ZX Spectrum which had better graphics resolution and colour bigger RAM and ROM as well 
en|as sound capability and a sleeker look and feel Some people still continued to use 
en|their and even the Spectrum users gave credit to Monster Maze as the game that

en|marked the rise of the use of techniques on microcomputers as small as the and

en|them There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met 
en|more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred 
en|in all their lives” The regiment was particularly effective at conducting raids along the coast

en|The Domination of the Draka also called the Draka series or the Draka saga is 
en|an alternate history series generally regarded as dystopian by American author S M Stirling It 
en|comprises a main trilogy of novels as well as one crossover novel set after the 
en|original and a book of short stories The series focuses on Draka later The Domination 
en|a totalitarian expansionist nation founded in South Africa by British settlers in the century where 
en|cruel slavery plays an increasingly central role In Stirling edited Drakas a collection of short 
en|stories by other authors who develop plots based on the Domination premise An omnibus edition 
en|of the Draka Saga was published in containing the first trilogy "Marching Through Georgia" "Under 
en|the Yoke" and "The Stone Dogs" The world of the Domination diverges from our world 
en|at the time of the American Revolutionary War when the Netherlands declares war on Great 
en|Britain resulting in the loss of its Cape Colony to the British After defeat in 
en|the Revolutionary War the Loyalists who historically went to Canada are instead resettled in the 
en|new Crown Colony of Drakia named after Sir Francis Drake in South Africa taking their 
en|slaves with them Thousands of Hessian German mercenaries who fought on the Loyalist side are 
en|also paid off with land grants in the new colony The Crown Colony of Drakia 
en|later the Dominion of the Draka is an aggressive militaristic slaveowning society massively influenced by 
en|the attitudes of these American slave owner settlers that are allowed to run unchecked reinforced 
en|over the course of the late and century by Icelanders fleeing their island after the 
en|volcanic devastation French royalists defeated American Confederates and other reactionary refugees also emigrate to the 
en|colony The much earlier Dutch Boer settlers are completely assimilated by these subsequent immigrants The 
en|genealogical lineage of both the original Boer and Southern Loyalist settlers from the late century 
en|and respectively is almost overwhelmingly made up of AngloSaxons Nordic Germanics and Celtics although these 
en|immigrant groups also include the scattered descendants of French Protestant Huguenots fleeing persecution in Roman 
en|Catholic France and later the aforementioned French aristocrats seeking sanctuary from the French Revolution Although 
en|most Draka remain at least nominally Christian for several generations by the the practice of 
en|Christianity among them has declined to the point that the few remaining Christian Citizens are 
en|subject to scrutiny by the Security Directorate and unofficially prevented from attaining officer ranks in 
en|the military The Draka capital city is Archona on the site of our own world's 
en|Pretoria The uppermost strata of Draka society by the century was composed of the hereditary 
en|plantation families the "old Domination" aristocracy descended from Loyalists that fled America who monopolized landholding 
en|early on Over time a new prosperous technocratic subclass emerged below this one as the 
en|Domination industrialized though it was still just "emerging" even as late as the Eurasian War 
en|as the Domination was inclined to rely on slave labor more than industrialization The Dutch 
en|Boer population actually did manage to survive as a distinct Draka subclass after a fashion 
en|discontent with being edged out of landholding by the vastly more numerous Loyalist immigrants Dutch 
en|Boer families came to dominate the officer pool of the Draka Navy By the Eurasian 
en|War of course the Draka Navy was still disproportionately very small due to their heavy 
en|reliance upon land warfare which made it both easier for the entire institution to be 
en|dominated by a handful of Dutch Boer families and at the same time guaranteed that 
en|it would always be a minority power in wider Draka politics The Confederates who immigrated 
en|after defeat in the American Civil War arrived too late to join the landholding class 
en|or the industrialist class and the Dutch Boers already had a firm control on the 
en|Navy Instead as this coincided with a great outburst of Draka expansion the Confederate immigrant 
en|families filled the rapidly expanding Security Directorate secret police Paralleling how the Navy was dominated 
en|by Dutch Boers by the Eurasian War the Security Directorate was dominated by Confederatedescended hereditary 
en|families who wielded considerable influence in militarized Draka society Citizens who are free and can 
en|vote comprise only a small fraction of the Domination's population Over of the population are 
en|slaves When the United Kingdom and most of the British Empire abolish slavery during the 
en|the Draka avoided emancipation by labeling their slaves "serfs" At first serfs are officially debt 
en|laborers who can earn their freedom but this is a feeble legal fiction This pretense 
en|is dropped when the Draka withdraw from the Empire but the word "serf" remains the 
en|standard term Serfs have no rights and are not allowed to handle money Their testimony 
en|is inadmissible in any court Any child born to a serf mother is a serf 
en|Sex between a male serf and a female Draka is a capital offense for both 
en|parties At first serfs are all African blacks and Draka citizenship is open to all 
en|whites although Nordic Anglo Saxon and Celtic types are especially welcomed Because Draka expansion is 
en|based solely on enslaving conquered peoples they soon have serfs from other races including whites 
en|As Draka social mores diverge more and more from those of free societies and the 
en|Draka are more and more widely hated they evolve an ideology in which they are 
en|"The Race" — the natural overlords of all humanity Those nonDraka not already enslaved are 
en|"feral serfs" who represent a permanent threat to the survival of the Draka Thus the 
en|Draka are dedicated to enslaving all humanity since the only alternative is the extinction of 
en|The Race Almost all Draka citizens own at least a few slaves The Draka are 
en|heavily outnumbered meaning that a slave rebellion is a constant threat In response the Draka 
en|are utterly ruthless in their discipline of serfs Impalement is the favored Draka method of 
en|executing rebellious serfs Nonetheless many Draka especially those who are central characters in the novels 
en|aim to create an idealized "rural community under a lord" feel on their lands Most 
en|Draka are quite fond of several of their serfs as a European or American might 
en|have a favorite horse Such an idealistic image is often spoiled however when punishment — 
en|always severe — has to be enacted Killing a serf is never a crime though 
en|it is a possible tort when the serf is the property of another Draka The 
en|citizen Draka army is made up of shock troops meant to be used as the 
en|arm of decision in maneuver warfare These Citizen troops are to a man and woman 
en|superb physical specimens unbelievably strong with startling muscle definition astonishing stamina and reactions and are 
en|the equal of several elite enemy soldiers due to their fanatical and relentless dedication to 
en|fitness physical conditioning endless combat training and diet Draka men and women are trained for 
en|combat from their infancy Free Draka troops can be disciplined by superior officers for neglecting 
en|to keep their physiques and fitness sharply honed to the highest possible standard although this 
en|would be extremely rare as poor physical conditioning would be seen as an affront to 
en|one's family and reputation Their physical regimen is expected to be maintained in times of 
en|relative peace as the Draka are almost always on a permanent war footing For attritional 
en|warfare the Domination uses Janissary slave soldiers who make up of the Draka army These 
en|troops are also quite formidable and are probably on a par with regular Alliance combatants 
en|although they are less well armed or equipped than their Draka masters or enemy troops 
en|Draka soldiers neither ask nor give quarter—all captured enemies are killed permanently enslaved or on 
en|very rare occasions used as hostages to trade for serfs and Janissaries captured by the 
en|enemy or Citizen troops who for some reason have been unable to take their own 
en|lives to avoid capture perhaps through injury because Draka are never willingly captured alive Several 
en|of the books' characters however do pay professional if not personal respect from time to 
en|time to the bravery skill and tenacity of enemy troops they encounter and if the 
en|enemy's equipment doesn't always impress the Draka occasionally acknowledge their good use of it In 
en|the books Draka equipment from tanks to tankbusting aircraft seems deliberately evocative of century military 
en|equipment enhancing the otherworldliness and superiority of the Draka in technological as well as purely 
en|physical sense The assault rifles used by Draka citizensoldiers feature integral bipods and optical sights 
en|while support weaponry includes nerve gas grenades and magazinefed mortars Descriptions of the Draka Hond 
en|tanks evoke images of modern tanks such as the Abrams In a similar vein flashbacks 
en|involving some of the older characters reveal that the Draka had a large dirigible air 
en|force capable of strategic bombing during the First World War From Under the Yoke onwards 
en|Draka equipment takes an even more sciencefiction turn Genetically modified baboon shock troops containing the 
en|DNA of certain species of dogs and humans as well combat spacecraft and paininducing irremovable 
en|bracelets for troublesome slaves make appearances While in The Stone Dogs the Protracted Struggle is 
en|still primarily a Cold Waresque arms race of nuclear capability modified geneticallytargeted diseases and advanced 
en|computer viruses also make an appearance Being focused on land conquests the Domination always had 
en|a disproportionately small navy even through the Eurasian War World War II The budget for 
en|the coastal patrol and brownwater naval units maintained by the Security Directorate during the Eurasian 
en|War was actually greater than the combined budget of the entire bluewater Draka Navy An 
en|attempted amphibious invasion of Spain during the Eurasian War was left stalled at its beachheads 
en|a rare moment in which the Drakas fell short of complete success After the Eurasian 
en|War however with increasing reliance upon air power and spaceflight this became an increasingly moot 
en|point Commanding ranks in Citizen's Force where free citizens serve A fullstrength legion has about 
en|citizens and about serf auxiliaries who are unarmed support personnel in noncombatant functions The Janissary 
en|units are commanded by citizen officers and for the serf soldiers use the traditional ranks 
en|from Private to Master Sergeant the highest rank available to subject race personnel During the 
en|the Draka trade extensively with India Ceylon is an early conquest which leads to a 
en|fad for Mughal artwork Some new Draka cities are also given Indianstyle names including Diskarapur 
en|Newcastle and Shahnapur Maputo From early in the nineteenth century the Draka develop a craze 
en|for Classical Antiquity and draw from it much of their military and political terminology It 
en|is explained that during the early and rapid conquest of Egypt in Draka scouts stumbled 
en|upon a long lost treasure trove of all the lost works of the GrecoRoman world 
en|which sparked off this fixation Antiquity provides the Draka with a readymade model of "colourblind 
en|slavery" The ancient Greeks and Romans saw no problem in enslaving people of the same 
en|skin colour as themselves and even of the same language and culture though with them 
en|unlike the Draka the wholesale enslavement of a defeated enemy was the exception rather than 
en|the rule and their slaves could and frequently did gain manumission see Slavery in antiquity 
en|Their core population being primarily composed of Loyalists who fled from the American Revolution and 
en|officially being a British colony for many decades the Draka speak English but with a 
en|very odd accent which it is difficult for nonDraka spies to imitate perfectly Some attempt 
en|is made to transcribe the Draka accent phonetically in books though it is stated that 
en|these are only rough approximations It is described as generally sounding like a Southern United 
en|States drawl mixed with an undertone of guttural Germanic sounds from Afrikaans given that the 
en|original core population were Loyalist families that fled the American revolution to South Africa which 
en|then received large immigrant waves from the defeated Confederate States of America and losing sides 
en|from the German revolutions in Europe The Draka enforce their English dialect on subject peoples 
en|and gradually outlaw conquered peoples from speaking their native languages Dozens of major languages across 
en|Africa and Eurasia are rendered extinct as a result along with hundreds of minor ones 
en|Localized accents persist up to a point among certain conquered peoples ie those conquered in 
en|the last three generations or so but their overall goal is to enforce linguistic uniformity 
en|The Dominion draws substantially from the ideology of Friedrich Nietzsche and similar philosophers and can 
en|be viewed as an "AntiAmerica" in the sense that like the United States the Draka 
en|nation started off as a British settler colony but evolved along diametrically opposite lines While 
en|the United States had slavery even slaveholders had to nominally adhere to the American values 
en|of liberty and equality and the contradiction was eventually resolved by the American Civil War 
en|The Draka on the other hand view themselves as a master race and unlike the 
en|Nazis who believed that their mere racial heritage made them superior are keenly aware of 
en|the effort they must make to maintain this status; in the manner of ancient Sparta 
en|all Draka citizen children attend sexsegregated boarding schools with an extreme emphasis on military prowess 
en|and physical conditioning While the United States in the century set for itself the goal 
en|of equality for all regardless of race the Draka worked to enslave all nonDraka humans 
en|also regardless of race Politically the Draka state is described as 'aristocratic republic' with a 
en|parliamentary system of government The Archon is the head of state appointed for a term 
en|by a parliament elected in free and fair elections Draka citizens have a considerable degree 
en|of free speech but fundamental criticism of the slave system is forbidden The Draka economy 
en|is heavily dominated by cartels known as Combines with ownership split between the state and 
en|the Landholders' League citizens can only own the right to use land not the land 
en|itself which can be confiscated in the event of neglect or misuse There is also 
en|a considerable smallbusiness private sector The Draka economy is on the gold standard with the 
en|basic unit of currency being the Auric In the third novel with gold becoming plentiful 
en|due to imports from space the Draka switch to the Auric reflecting a basket of 
en|commodities The Draka take over Egypt and Ceylon from the French during the Napoleonic Wars 
en|and over the course of the century the Draka gradually conquer and enslave all of 
en|Africa The last areas to be conquered were the jungles of the Congo due to 
en|the danger of tropical diseases Technological development is faster than in our own history as 
en|the Draka put the wealth derived from their vast gold and diamond deposits to effective 
en|use by offering large grants to scientists and inventors who settle in their territory and 
en|develop new inventions These include Richard Trevithick inventor of the steam locomotive who settles in 
en|Virconium equivalent to our own world's Durban in R J Gatling who settles in Diskarapur 
en|in and Louis Pasteur who discovers malaria's mosquito vector in the while working for the 
en|Shahnapur Institute of Tropical Medicine The United States is also much more expansionistic than in 
en|our own timeline – it annexes Canada after the War of a conquest presumably made 
en|easier in this timeline by the absence of Loyalist American settlers to enlarge the Canadian 
en|population and Mexico after the Mexican–American War since it is implied the addition of numerous 
en|Northern FreeSoil states following the conquest of Canada strengthened Southern demands for a reciprocal campaign 
en|to increase the number of slaveholding states with representation in Congress William Walker's Southern adventurers 
en|conquer Central America; while Cuba Hispaniola Hawaii and the Philippines are annexed in During the 
en|American Civil War the Draka supply massive amounts of aid to the Confederacy including steampowered 
en|armored cars However the Union still wins the Civil War with the help of large 
en|numbers of Mexican conscripts and annexes Walker's Central American empire Cuba Hispaniola Hawaii and the 
en|Philippines are granted statehood in with the Central American territories following later The United States 
en|eventually has states in total The Empire of Brazil seizes control of Bolivia Paraguay Uruguay 
en|and the Guyanas in the the same decade which sees the United Kingdom uniting Australia 
en|and New Zealand as the Dominion of Australasia In addition the Republic of Gran Colombia 
en|never breaks up into the nations of Colombia Venezuela and Ecuador as in our world 
en|This exemplifies the trend in the series of fewer and fewer nations achieving sovereign independent 
en|status In China the Taiping Rebellion is successful resulting in a China which is even 
en|more incapable of successful modernization than in our own history The Japanese victory in the 
en|First SinoJapanese War which in the Draka timeline occurs in is even more decisive with 
en|Japan not only annexing Formosa but also Korea Hainan and several Chinese coastal cities After 
en|victory in the RussoJapanese War Japan annexes Manchuria and establishes a protectorate over the weak 
en|Taiping Dynasty The Dominion of Draka joins the Allied side in the Great War and 
en|conquers the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria It subsequently declares its independence from United Kingdom and 
en|renames itself the Domination of the Draka The Domination of Draka then takes advantage of 
en|the Russian Civil War and seizes the rest of the Middle East much of Central 
en|Asia and China west of Xian and Wuhan Up to Janissaries die in pacification campaigns 
en|during this time in the Domination's new territories Sixtyfive percent of the population of Afghanistan 
en|is exterminated in retaliation for the fierce resistance of that nation's "Badmash" rebels In the 
en|Empire of Japan deposes the Taiping Emperor and annexes all Chinese territory not in Draka 
en|hands After the death of Vladimir Lenin a second civil war further weakened the Soviet 
en|Union which is won by a faction led by Joseph Stalin—who subsequently orders a "hermit 
en|kingdom" isolationist policy Under the influence of Draka philosophers such as Elvira Naldorssen the traditional 
en|Draka white supremacism is replaced by Drakasupremacism with the Draka viewing all of nonDrakan humanity 
en|as their cattle Naldorssen explains the ideology of the Domination the utter amorality of which 
en|will lead enemies of the Draka to refer to them as 'Snakes' The first book 
en|of the series Marching Through Georgia is a war story set during the Eurasian War 
en|the Domination timeline's equivalent of World War II In this war the Nazis utterly crushed 
en|the Soviet Union with only a Siberian rump state beyond the Urals surviving under a 
en|junta led by Marshal Timoshenko The Nazi success derives from the Soviets suffering two recent 
en|devastating civil wars and needing to defend a long southern border with the Domination Additionally 
en|the LendLease between the United States and the Soviets was rendered ineffective by Nazi Uboats 
en|effecting a powerful blockade in the Atlantic Japanese naval hegemony in the Pacific and the 
en|Domination's refusal to allow lendlease supplies through its territory The Domination entered the war just 
en|before the Nazi invasion of Russia and conquered Italy with the Nazis' tacit consent The 
en|Draka then attacked the Third Reich in the Caucasus region attempting to cut off a 
en|large part of the German army The German Wehrmacht is somewhat more advanced than historically 
en|with a fully mechanized supply train The WaffenSS units facing the Draka Citizen Airborne unit 
en|the novel centers around are also in possession of numerous 'hybrid' armoured vehicles made from 
en|German and captured Soviet parts but they are still no match for the Draka army 
en|The Draka citizen soldiers female as well as male are honed killing machines each equal 
en|to several of their enemy on the battlefield The Draka also have superb weaponry including 
en|Hond III tanks with armor engine size and gun caliber approaching those of modern MBTs 
en|and powerful air force which includes highperformance single and twin piston engine fighters airborne early 
en|warning systems mounted on dirigibles and a twinengine armored ground attack aircraft By all sides 
en|are widely using nerve gas jet and rocketpowered fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles The United 
en|States is forced into the war when the entire Pacific Fleet is wiped out at 
en|Pearl Harbor Japanese forces occupy the US states of Hawaii the Philippines and the Panama 
en|Canal Zone Additionally Japan occupies northern Australia raids California and the Imperial Japanese Navy shells 
en|Acapulco Consequently the United States cannot open a second front in Europe Alliance with the 
en|Nazis against the Draka is also impossible due to the influence of the Jewish lobby 
en|and a Draka threat to supply Japan with nuclear weaponsrelated materials in the event of 
en|USGerman peace In the Alliance for Democracy is formed—comprising the military alliance free trade area 
en|and monetary union This Alliance includes the Americas the United Kingdom India and unoccupied Australia 
en|The United States turned the tide against Japan with victory in the Battle of the 
en|Sea of Cortez in which jet fighterbombers armed with guided bombs played a crucial role 
en|Hawaii was liberated in late and half of the surviving Imperial Japanese Navy was destroyed 
en|in a nuclear cruise missile attack on the Truk naval base In late Tokyo was 
en|destroyed by a nuclear cruise missile—killing over people including the Imperial Family A fanatical military 
en|government takes over Japan The Draka overrun Europe as far as the Pyrenees with the 
en|decisive blow made with five atomic bombs against the industrial areas of the Ruhr Adolf 
en|Hitler himself it is revealed in later flashbacks was assassinated by a cadre of generals 
en|in Without his meddling the German Wehrmacht puts up much more stubborn and effective resistance 
en|than it did historically against the Soviet Union but the memory of Hitler means that 
en|the rest of Europe is loath to unite behind the Germans to halt the Draka 
en|Numerous Draka characters credit Hitler's memory as a key factor in ensuring Draka victory in 
en|Europe In the Draka completed its conquest of Europe by using its remaining stockpile of 
en|atomic bombs to force the Pyrenees—finally defeating a communist Spain following a different outcome to 
en|reality's Spanish Civil War The United Kingdom remained free and was inundated with refugees The 
en|Draka then turned its attention to the Far East attacking Japaneseoccupied China Despite the rapid 
en|Draka conquest of Eastern China and Korea the loss of the remaining Japanese naval units 
en|in the Battle of the Philippines the nuclear destruction of Osaka and the Alliance invasion 
en|of Kyushu Japan continues a bitter resistance only surrendering to the Alliance in July in 
en|fear of a Draka invasion of the Home Islands The Eurasian War claimed some million 
en|lives over three times the death toll of our own World War II The liberated 
en|SouthEast Asian Federation and Indochinese Republic become members of the Alliance for Democracy as does 
en|a reconstructed Japan in The United Kingdom minus the Channel Islands is the only remaining 
en|free nation left in Europe and is heavily defended and fortified against potential Draka attack 
en|The Domination and the Alliance thus control the entire world between them The second book 
en|Under the Yoke shows Europe under Draka rule The Draka ruthlessly crush all resistance in 
en|Europe European institutions are remorselessly removed obliterated and forbidden although religions albeit heavily modified by 
en|the Draka overlords are tolerated as means of further controlling the enserfed population Schools universities 
en|and all seats of learning are similarly eradicated Any serfs caught in possession of radios 
en|or literature are summarily executed Languages are encouraged to die out except for a few 
en|remaining mutually unintelligible local dialects and are replaced amongst serfs by the slurred Drakan version 
en|of English Finland is almost completely depopulated and in when a rebellion takes over the 
en|city of Barcelona the Draka respond with a thermonuclear bomb Under the Yoke contains a 
en|deliberately horrific description of the impalement of several French Maquis guerrilla soldiers disgusting even the 
en|Draka who ordered it who nevertheless considers it a necessary means of impressing upon the 
en|slaves that resistance is futile Thus they will obey more willingly making it possible for 
en|the Draka to be less harsh giving rise to even further willingness to obey The 
en|Draka have been slavemasters for two hundred years and have applied modern science to the 
en|problem of breaking human wills; they are extremely good at it Indeed this feeds further 
en|into their ideology of the Draka as a master race with individuals capable of enforcing 
en|their will over many serfs with no other tool than raw willpower In this book 
en|mention is made from both the conquered peoples and the Draka themselves of the Western 
en|Allies refusal to join forces with Nazi Germany even though Adolf Hitler was dead by 
en|late officially by heart attack but in reality assassinated by German Military Intelligence to fight 
en|the Draka once the full horror of the Drakan onslaught's threat to European civilisation is 
en|apparent Widespread disgust and revulsion at Germany's genocidal policies towards political ideological and racial enemies 
en|and utter hatred by former occupied countries are cited as the cause of this reluctance 
en|even though the Draka treatment to defeated enemies is by that stage universally known Both 
en|Nazi Germany and the Allies foolishly thought they could defeat the Draka without uniting The 
en|third book The Stone Dogs tells the story of the Protracted Struggle—the Cold War between 
en|the Domination of the Draka and the Alliance for Democracy There is a far more 
en|intense space race in this world with nuclear pulsedrive interplanetary spaceships and colonies and military 
en|bases established on the Moon on Mars and in the asteroid belt Over a period 
en|of several decades the Alliance secretly constructs an antimatterdriven starship for transporting people to Alpha 
en|Centauri in the event of a Draka victory The Draka employ the policy of "No 
en|peace beyond Luna" leading to frequent skirmishes in the inner solar system It is not 
en|unknown although extremely rare for people from the Domination to defect to the Alliance Citizens 
en|primarily seek asylum due to personal convictions while serfs simply want to escape their bondage 
en|Any citizen or serf caught attempting to defect would be summarily executed though the serf 
en|would no doubt meet a more hideous death probably by impalement or breaking on the 
en|wheel These defectors prove valuable to the OSS because of the unique opportunity it offers 
en|regarding gathering vital information on Drakan society the Drakan dialect which is notoriously difficult to 
en|acquire and master and the Drakan fighting style which is unmatched anywhere in the Alliance 
en|In the there is a major setback for the Free World An OSS covert operation 
en|designed to discredit a Hindu nationalist party and keep India in the Alliance backfires as 
en|a suicide note is found implicating the OSS in the scandal As a result India 
en|secedes from the Alliance—and is conquered and enslaved by the Draka within weeks except Burma 
en|which counterseceded back to the Alliance After the 'Indian Incident' the Alliance for Democracy is 
en|formally converted into a single superstate The much larger free population of the Alliance gives 
en|it an edge in physics and computer technology while the Domination gains the upper hand 
en|in the biological sciences allowing them to perfect their genetic engineering techniques by using their 
en|slave population as test subjects They finish the Human Genome Project and are performing significant 
en|genetic alteration on mammalian organisms including humans by the Both sides develop superweapons with which 
en|to launch the first strike of the inevitable final war However both sides recognize that 
en|the longterm trends are in the Alliance's favor Due to its much larger economy and 
en|free population the Alliance's lead in overall scientific progress slowly grows with the stagnant Draka 
en|increasingly dependent on espionage and Alliance defectors for new innovations The war finally breaks out 
en|in when the Draka about to lose the secrecy of their superweapon decide to use 
en|it preemptively instead Draka advantages in bioscience allowed it to create a biopsychological virus "The 
en|Stone Dogs" This virus lies dormant but causes the host to go violently insane when 
en|activated by precisely modulated very long wavelength radio waves The Alliance counterpart a computer virus 
en|designed to trigger selfdestruct mechanisms in Draka military units that go to war footing works 
en|well but is not as effective at disabling the enemy command and control or crippling 
en|their space forces Due to the Stone Dogs virus Draka forces ultimately succeed—if barely—in wiping 
en|out all significant Alliance populations and military forces in the EarthLuna sphere In the process 
en|they lose percent of the Citizen population and percent of the serf million total The 
en|Alliance though suffering million casualties and losing its Ceres command center wins in transLunar space 
en|including the Belt A truce is declared allowing the Alliance remnants in the Belt to 
en|launch the starship while giving other Alliance remnants in space limited Draka citizenship the new 
en|Draka will not be able to vote though their children will be The war itself 
en|proves to be devastating to Earth Though the Solar System belongs to the Draka the 
en|planet's ecosystems were pushed nearly to the breaking point The war causes a nuclear winter 
en|lasting for several years a climatic disturbance so severe that ice forms in the Adriatic 
en|Sea despite most nukes being 'clean' fusion weapons and Archon Eric von Shrakenberg in an 
en|effort to limit damage to the planet ordering no more nuclear weapons used within the 
en|atmosphere after a certain point in the conflict At some intervening period before the next 
en|book in the series the Draka produce a genetically altered new serf race Homo servus 
en|which is incapable of rebelling This is accomplished by making servus vulnerable to dominance and 
en|sexual arousal pheromones as well as changing their genetic temperaments toward the emotional and nonaggressive 
en|Thus they can dispense with the brutal repression needed earlier and entrust serfs with sensitive 
en|positions such as theoretical physics Because of additional chromosomes added to the drakensis genome drakensis 
en|and servus cannot interbreed precluding any "half breed" versions of the drakensis "Master Race" A 
en|'paravirus' is mentioned as the method of converting Homo sapiens serfs to Homo servus the 
en|sex cells being transformed with the result that infected human parents give birth to servus 
en|children However it is not clear that this advanced method was the one used for 
en|the initial changes to human serfs in the early century Of Homo sapiens only a 
en|few scattered "feral humans" survive precariously on Earth mainly in North America having been quite 
en|literally bombed back into the Stone Age nearly wiped out with "biobombs" and being hunted 
en|"for sport" by the Draka The Pygmies of Central Africa are also allowed to survive 
en|on special lands reserved for their use Drakon takes place in an alternate universe version 
en|of our It begins in the year aka FS or the Year of the Final 
en|Society of the Draka history The Domination is pitted against the postAmerican world of Samothrace 
en|in the Alpha Centauri system which is a colony of Alliance refugees from the Final 
en|War A failed experiment intended to research wormholes called "moleholes" for FTL travel causes a 
en|single Drakensis the geneticallyengineered posthuman species of Draka Gwendolyn Ingolfsson to be sent to the 
en|of an alternate universe very similar to our own The only notable difference is that 
en|Kenneth Branagh played ObiWan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel though his casting occurs after 
en|Ingolfsson's incursion in indicating that the introduction of "holoprojectors" by IngolfTech might have attracted a 
en|higherquality lead in the film of our universe The Samothracians send one of their own 
en|agents cyborg soldier Kenneth Lafarge to stop her Lefarge arrives in the alternate due to 
en|the crude nature of the time travel technology Both Lefarge and Ingolfsson create organizations of 
en|native humans to aid their fight against each other Lefarge's team being led by NYPD 
en|Detective Henry Caramaggio Both Lefarge and Ingolfsson are killed in an epic battle in New 
en|York City when the Drakensis attempts to activate a beacon to allow the Draka scientists 
en|of FS several years having elapsed to lock a transit wormhole to the alternate In 
en|the time between and in the Domination's home timeline the Samothracians attack the Domination's Earth 
en|via a series of wormholes laid between Alpha Centauri and Sol These attacks ultimately did 
en|not succeed however the Draka barely managed to beat back the assault The Alliance colony 
en|on Samothrace still enjoyed the societal advantages its faction had during the original Protracted Struggle 
en|ie that as a free society their rate of scientific progress and discovery is much 
en|faster than the stagnant totalitarian slavemasters of the Draka Given four centuries the scant colonists 
en|on Samothrace were able to establish a new industrial base on a virgin planet and 
en|design better weapons than the Draka to the point that their assault first assault nearly 
en|succeeded in taking back Earth Thanks to perfectly faked documents provided by Lefarge Ingolfsson's estates 
en|laboratories and archives of advanced technologies fall into Caramaggio's hands who according to the frame 
en|story of The Domination becomes "the richest man in the world" within twenty years Caramaggio 
en|releases Ingolfsson's technologies at a rapid rate attempting to prepare his Earth for another Draka 
en|attack Since unknown to Caramaggio Ingolfsson transferred her knowledge into her infant daughter the struggle 
en|will no doubt resume at some point The series has been criticized on various places 
en|on the internet for giving the Draka an impossibly fastspreading and technologically advancing society as 
en|well as for assuming that the British would have tolerated the Draka's harsh slavery When 
en|asked about these attacks on the implausibility of the series in an interview Stirling answered 
en|There's a small internet industry of 'proving' that the Domination couldn't happen I consider this 
en|a complement sic How many people go on at great length trying to prove that 
en|vampires and werewolves don't Stirling's use of the Draka as pointofview characters has led to 
en|accusations that he has some sympathy with them for example in his entry in The 
en|Encyclopedia of Science Fiction to his dismay He describes the Draka series as dystopias based 
en|on "supposing that everything had turned out as badly as possible these last few The

en|Transcarpathia In the mid the Dutch relief organisation Stichting Hulp OostEuropa delivered a large amount 
en|of humanitarian relief to many Ukrainian state orphanages This however failed to reach the children 
en|Having satisfied themselves that this was the case and in view of the dreadful state 
en|of affairs prevailing at that time in Ukrainian state orphanages; the lack of basic hygiene 
en|indifference towards the children the physically and mentally retarded condition of the children the poor 
en|condition of the buildings and the impracticality of improvement they decided to set up a 
en|Christian children's home which could serve as a model for the whole of Ukraine At 
en|the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union Stichting Hulp OostEuropa together with the 
en|Weeshuis der Hervormden Lindenhof and the Partnerhilfe foundations started to organise this and by March 
en|after two years of construction the brand new twocone basic building more than feet in 
en|Nagydobrony near Uzhhorod in Ukraine was ready for occupation On December the children's home was 
en|handed over with all due ceremony to the district of the Reformed Church of Transcarpathia 
en|to which it officially belongs From its inception the establishment made every endeavour after selfsufficiency 
en|by setting up its own farm Supporting funds were sufficient from the very beginning for 
en|a wide variety of things so much so that whatever new building was needed it 
en|could be built from the surplus In the course of time however due to continually 
en|rising prices and cost of wages coupled with stagnation of supporting funds not only was 
en|the work unable to be finished but now the yearly support funds do not even 
en|cover the minimum annual wage of the children's carers alone In reality the majority of 
en|the workers are on a partly voluntary basis Compensation for the belowaverage wages is by 
en|allowances in kind and other concessions eg holiday leave Electricity and gas is purchased at 
en|industrial prices and for that reason it has not been possible so far to implement 
en|gas heating it is too expensive The Ukrainian state has provided no material assistance apart 
en|from an uptodate computer in February from the district council As one of the models 
en|for the country the children's home is visited every year by government ministers various regional 
en|medical officers and some church bishops too The children's home itself is situated in an 
en|area of acres Here is the main building and a large outbuilding which everybody simply 
en|refers to as the "new building" In this area too are the cowshed stables pig 
en|shed and various other farm buildings garages the workshop and stores There are polytunnels ie 
en|polyethylene greenhouses which alone cover an area of SF It can be seen from the 
en|foregoing how much dependence there is on the farm set up through considerable effort together 
en|with gifts from abroad In the fields and polytunnels among other things carrots parsley kohlrabi 
en|potatoes radish cauliflower peas beans tomatoes paprika beetroot cabbage etc are grown Out of this 
en|other institutions are supported too An apiary provides honey for the children Cattle and pig 
en|stocks provide meat and dairy produce milk sour cream and cottage cheese Altogether approx acres 
en|is under cereals spelt durum wheat and other milling wheat providing allyearround feeding for the 
en|animals Unfortunately more often than not they are unsuitable for bread flour The working bakery 
en|supplies the daily bread requirements also rolls and approx types of bakery produce The bakery 
en|was set up with the help of donations from the Netherlands and the USA and 
en|has been in production since December The agricultural work required implements so the staff partly 
en|from donations set up a machine pool consisting of several tractors The upkeep and repair 
en|of the tractors and implements is done by the staff Since there has been a 
en|combine harvester and in the SARA foundation in the United States USA donated a brand 
en|new Belarus tractor The children take part in looking after the animals and in agricultural 
en|work so that they may experience what kind of work provides the food that reaches 
en|the table The aim for the children is that they should become useful members of 
en|the community For those children who on account of handicap will not be able to 
en|leave the children's home an appropriate field of activity is ensured so that they will 
en|not feel themselves superfluous So those girls wishing to proceed to further studies get wholehearted 
en|support to help them reach the goals they have set themselves There are a great 
en|many foreign visitors so from a guest house has provided suitable accommodation for supporters The 
en|guest house provides a conference hall with a seating capacity of giving opportunity to different 
en|organisations and groups to organise conferences eg medical mental health care agriculture etc The children's 
en|home keeps up a very good relationship with state orphanages schools children's hospitals psychiatric hospitals 
en|and institutions for the blind and deaf From the crops and the humanitarian aid received 
en|distribution is made according to ability to the abovementioned and other institutions Children from years 
en|old to years old are taken in but only girls Admission does not consider creed 
en|or ethnic background; only their need of help ie difficult social environment or those who 
en|are seriously handicapped physically or psychologically orphans oneparent children or those in situations where they 
en|are endangered of the children are such as have been given up by their parents 
en|years old children with various medical conditions have come from state orphanages each one of 
en|them diagnosed there as mentally and physically handicapped and lacking the ability to speak By 
en|the grace of God love and care can work wonders since nearly all of these 
en|children can now speak and right now children out of the in the home attend 
en|the village school and not with poor results either Five are now and year pupils 
en|in the Nagydobrony Reformed Lyceum From among the primary school children attend music school In 
en|the children's home itself there is a special class children do not go to school 
en|go to this special class and the other have already finished school and now work 
en|one as a kitchen assistant and the other as a secretary in the home This 
en|is not a closed institution like the state orphanages These children who are physically and 
en|mentally capable of attending school go by themselves to Nagydobrony High School more than yards 
en|away The older children attend church and take part in other activities too Here the 
en|children know the people in the village they see the flowers trees and animals belonging 
en|to the houses They learn the rules of the road they know their environment they 
en|meet friends and so it wil be easier for them later on to make their 
en|way in life Over and above this the children will stay as long as they 
en|need to that is for their whole lives Members of the local and neighbouring congregations 
en|can take their "own children" home from noon on Saturday till Sunday afternoon every second 
en|week Only such persons can do this as are morally suitable We seek by means 
en|of these family visits to form in the children a true picture of Christian family 
en|life which in a state institution they could never experience The children are divided into 
en|groups In setting up each group age personality and physical and mental capabilities are taken 
en|into account In each group there are children Each room has its own washroom and 
en|the disabled have their own specially fitted out washroom Education is provided in the building 
en|for those who are either physically incapable of going to school or who are mentally 
en|retarded In the grounds there is a flower bed yards long by wide for the 
en|children where even those confined to wheelchairs can enjoy the pleasure of gardening In the 
en|building there is a computer room with permanent internet access a therapy room a library 
en|a study room and a practice kitchen The children have the possibility of using various 
en|openair recreational facilities suited to each age group There are three small play areas a 
en|soccer field a feet diameter swimming pool and the opportunity to go horse riding too 
en|there is also a fish pond on which it is possible to go boating and

en|during the Mau Mau Uprising The Kikuyu Home Guard was named after the British Home

en|calls these early ad hoc anti Mau Mau groups the Kikuyu Resistance Groups which appeared 
en|in the last part of Its creation was an extremely divisive development within Kikuyu Its 
en|divisive nature was absolutely ensured by Baring's government's tentative desire to give the Home Guard 
en|the appearance of being a Kikuyuled Officially sanctioned by the colonial government at its peak 
en|in the Home Guard numbered more than men—more than the number of Mau Mau fighters 
en|in the Many joined voluntarily for a variety of reasons but particularly once the battle 
en|had begun to shift decisively against Mau Mau by late however in some districts up

en|the Tribal Policecitation needed As noted above the Guard was organised by the Kenya Administration 
en|rather than the Army or Police and Temporary District Officers were appointed to officer the 
en|guard In most cases individual platoons and sections of the Guard were officered by junior 
en|administration officials such as chiefs and headmen The Guard undertook a variety of mission roles 
en|For the majority of the time they guarded the fortified villages that had been set 
en|up to protect the Kikuyu from the Mau Mau In the early period of the 
en|Guard it was common for the Mau Mau to overrun these fortified positions because the 
en|Guard lacked sufficient firepower to resist their attackers In due course as the Guard demonstrated 
en|its political and military reliability the Kenya Government supplied shotguns and rifles to the Guard 
en|The Guard also took part in antiMau Mau sweeps and local patrolling Their local knowledge

en|The Rouge et Or have won a record ten Vanier Cup championships and their most 
en|recent victory occurred at the Vanier Cup in They are also the only program to 
en|have played in four straight Vanier Cups and have a record of in Vanier Cup 
en|The Rouge et Or have also won the Dunsmore Cup times since demonstrating their historical 
en|dominance in their conference The Rouge et Or football program was first conceived of by 
en|Mike Labadie a local physical education teacher and Jacques Tanguay a wealthy alumni and avid 
en|sports They had noticed that there were an exodus of Frenchspeaking football players to English 
en|speaking schools because there was no Francophone option for them to continue their football careers 
en|Tanguay invested heavily into the football program as the Rouge et Or began their first 
en|season in one year after the National Hockey League's Quebec Nordiques had left Quebec City 
en|to relocate to Labadie was the team's first head coach and they finished the year 
en|with a The following year Jacques Chapdelaine was hired to become the team's head coach 
en|The Rouge et Or were the first Canadian collegiate team to feature fulltime paid assistant 
en|coaches and the first to use video editing further giving them a heightened competitive Laval 
en|won their first national championship in against the Saint Mary's Huskies under head coach Chapdelaine 
en|bringing the Vanier Cup back to Quebec for the first time since Chapdelaine left the 
en|program following the season to continue his coaching career in the Canadian Football League In 
en|current head coach Glen Constantin was promoted from his defensive coordinator position and led the 
en|team to record and another Dunsmore However during that season the program had to vacate 
en|all victories due to use of an ineligible player Consequently that season is recorded as 
en|having eight regular season losses and three playoff For the following season in the Rouge 
en|et Or finished and lost to the Concordia Stingers in the QUFL semifinal This is 
en|notable because as of it is the last time that the Rouge et Or have 
en|had more than one regular season loss and the last time the program failed to 
en|qualify for the Dunsmore Cup The following season the Rouge et Or began their conference 
en|dominance scoring a school record points in eight regular season games over points on average 
en|per game en route to their second Dunsmore Cup The Rouge et Or finished that 
en|season with their second Vanier Cup victory also against Saint Mary's in the Vanier Cup 
en|which was Constantin's first as head In the Rouge et Or repeated as Vanier Cup 
en|champions for the first time in school history by defeating the Saskatchewan Huskies in the 
en|Vanier Laval became the fourth program in Canadian collegiate history to repeat as Vanier Cup 
en|champions It was the lowest scoring game in Vanier Cup history as Laval won by 
en|a score of and it was the first Vanier Cup held outside of Toronto as 
en|the game was played at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton In the Saskatchewan Huskies collected 
en|a measure of revenge as they defeated the Rouge et Or in the semifinal Mitchell 
en|Bowl in Saskatoon However in the following year the two teams met again in the 
en|Vanier Cup where the Vanier Cup was being played in Saskatoon for the first time 
en|and in the Huskies home stadium Griffiths The team claimed the rubber match by defeating 
en|the Saskatchewan Huskies in a game played in temperatures below Linebacker Éric Maranda that game's 
en|MVP was chosen to play in the US East–West Shrine Game in Houston Texas on 
en|January For the season the Rouge et Or claimed their fifth straight Dunsmore Cup championship 
en|but lost to the Saint Mary's Huskies in the Uteck Bowl in Huskies Stadium in 
en|Halifax It marked the last time as of that Laval had lost to a team 
en|from the Atlantic University Sport conference The following year Laval ranked first in Canada played 
en|in the Vanier Cup and defeated the thirdranked Western Mustangs to claim their fifth national 
en|It was the eighth time that Laval had finished their season paying in a national 
en|final or semifinal and oddly the first of those occurrences where the opposing team was 
en|not nicknamed the "Huskies" The season also saw the program produce its first Hec Crighton 
en|Trophy winner as Benoit Groulx was named the CIS football's most valuable Laval University hosted 
en|the Vanier Cup game for the first time in but the Rouge et Or lost 
en|to the eventual champion Queen's Golden Gaels in the Mitchell Bowl played at Richardson Memorial 
en|Stadium in Kingston However Laval was hosting backtoback Vanier Cup games and the Rouge et 
en|Or qualified for the Vanier Cup in There the Rouge et Or dominated the Calgary 
en|Dinos to win their sixth Vanier Cup They were the first team in CIS history 
en|to win straight games in weeks of play after they played nine regular season games 
en|in The RSEQ extended the regular season to nine games in Their defence also set 
en|a Vanier Cup record for fewest yards allowed beating the previous record of allowed by 
en|the Guelph Gryphons in Laval won in front of hometown fans becoming the second program 
en|to win the Vanier Cup at home with the Toronto Varsity Blues winning in and 
en|In the following season Laval lost a Vanier Cup game for the first time in 
en|program history as they fell to the McMaster Marauders in double overtime in the Vanier 
en|This game was played at BC Place and was the first Vanier Cup to be 
en|played in The Rouge et Or would exact a measure of revenge the following year 
en|in a rematch against the Marauders in the Vanier The team won a Canadian collegiate 
en|record seventh Vanier Cup championship in front of an also record crowd of fans at 
en|the Rogers Centre in Toronto by a score of In they won backtoback national championships 
en|for the second time in program history when they defeated the Calgary Dinos in the 
en|Vanier Cup by a score of The game was again played at Telus Stadium on 
en|the campus of Laval University in front of The season saw the full rise of 
en|the Montreal Carabins to prominence as they not only defeated the Rouge et Or in 
en|the regular season but they also defeated them in the postseason and at home in 
en|the Dunsmore Cup It snapped Laval's home winning streak combined regular season and postseason and 
en|Dunsmore Cup winning Proving that was no fluke the Carabins again defeated the Rouge et 
en|Or the following year in Quebec City in the Dunsmore Cup and would again represent 
en|the RSEQ in the Vanier In the Rouge et Or finished in second place in 
en|the RSEQ after losing the headtohead tiebreaker to the Carabins Nonetheless they defeated those Carabins 
en|in Montreal in the Dunsmore Cup and advanced to their tenth Vanier Cup appearance in 
en|the Vanier Cup In that game the Rouge et Or came back on top by 
en|squeezing a narrow victory against the Calgary Dinos in Hamilton at Tim Hortons The Rouge 
en|et Or qualified for the Vanier Cup the following year but were soundly defeated by 
en|the Western Mustangs by a score of It was their most lopsided loss since they 
en|were defeated by the Saint Mary's Huskies by a similar margin in their loss in

en|returning to the national championship game and defeating the Mustangs by a score of in 
en|front of a home crowd in the Vanier Cup The win capped the fourth undefeated 
en|season in program history On October a record fans attended the Rouge et Or game

en|Ocean Girl titled Ocean Odyssey in the UK is an Australian science fiction TV series 
en|aimed for family audiences and starring Marzena Godecki as the lead character The show is 
en|set in the near future and focuses on an unusual girl named Neri who lives 
en|alone on an island and the friendships she develops with the inhabitants of an underwater 
en|research facility called ORCA Oceanic Research Centre of Australia the show is an example of 
en|deep ecology science fiction Ocean Girl inspired an animated series The New Adventures of Ocean 
en|Girl which ran from to and has since been released on DVD The animated series 
en|is in a distinct reboot separate from the original liveaction show Neri the title character 
en|is a young girl with an affinity for water the ability to swim long distances 
en|and superhuman lung capacity She lives alone on an otherwise deserted island and sleeps in 
en|a nest in a tree Early in the first season Neri befriends two Australian boys; 
en|Jason and Brett Bates The Bates brothers live in an elaborate underwater research and environmental 
en|protection facility called ORCA Oceanic Research Center of Australia located near Port Douglas Queensland At 
en|the beginning of the series their mother Dr Dianne Bates has been assigned to ORCA 
en|to study whale song in the hopes of facilitating crossspecies communication A significant portion of 
en|the series takes place on ORCA itself and looks at the activities of its inhabitants 
en|which includes the schoolaged children of the resident scientists such as Jason and Brett Jason 
en|discovers Neri while on a whaletracking expedition with his mother While attempting to tag a 
en|whale using a harpoon from the boat Jason is startled by a young girl Neri 
en|who appears in the water and positions herself between Jason and the whale saying "No 
en|no" Jason freezes and fails to release the harpoon Dr Bates rushes out to the 
en|ship's deck grabs the harpoon and tags the whale albeit missing the intended target area 
en|Dr Bates is furious with Jason and doesn't believe his story about a girl appearing 
en|in the water Actually no one believes Jason at first and he is ridiculed by 
en|the other children on ORCA Brett is the second character to know of Neri's existence 
en|Brett and Jason's friendship with Neri is at first a highly guarded secret due to 
en|Neri's fear of other humans As the series progresses it is revealed that Neri came 
en|to Earth on a spaceship with her father when she was young though his death 
en|soon after the ship's crash left Neri to fend for herself Prior to meeting Jason 
en|and Brett Neri's only friend was a humpback whale a jali in Neri's native tongue 
en|whom she names "Charley" and with whom she can communicate Later in the series Neri's 
en|curiosity leads her to explore ORCA while Dr Bates's study of Charley's whale song helps 
en|her identify Neri as the intended recipient of that song Eventually Dr Bates and her 
en|assistant Dr Winston Seth become embroiled in Jason and Brett's effort to keep Neri a 
en|secret while also performing numerous tests on Neri to understand how she's able to communicate 
en|with whales At the same time that the Bates family learn about Neri a rival 
en|research organisation the UBRI Corporation are introduced Headed by the sinister Dr Hellegren UBRI have 
en|learned that a spacecraft landed somewhere in the vicinity of ORCA and begin their own 
en|search for any personnel that may have survived Simultaneously they work on other projects which 
en|threaten the natural ecology of the ocean around ORCA Eventually they put in play an 
en|effort to build the socalled "ORCA City" an elaborate underwater construction that will likely eradicate 
en|much of the natural life on the seabed In response Dr Bates's mission changes over 
en|the course of the series from cetologist to environmental protectionist This role becomes more prominent 
en|beginning with the third season when UBRI representatives establish themselves on board ORCA Accordingly the 
en|series shifts to a more serious tone in its later seasons As Neri gradually discovers 
en|more of her island and ORCA she also begins to understand her greater purpose This 
en|selfawakening is particularly enhanced by encounters with others of her kind In the second season 
en|she discovers her sister Mera and the two are given the opportunity to return to 
en|their home planet Mera avails herself of this option but Neri stays feeling that she 
en|must discover what her father was trying to do on Earth In the third season 
en|she gains entry into the downed spacecraft that originally brought her to Earth There she 
en|finds another of her people in suspended animation The new character Kal proves to be 
en|the son of the commander of the vessel and helps her tap into the ship's 
en|memory core She finds the ship's log in which Kal's mother explains that Neri's father 
en|was to repair the damage done to Earth's oceans with an advanced device called the 
en|Synchronium She then dedicates her life to her father's cause giving her a genuine sense 
en|of purpose that she had perhaps lacked earlier in the series Kal grows jealous of 
en|the strong bond between Neri and Jason Bates and begins hating Neri's friends on ORCA 
en|As protest Kal leaves the island Neri and her ORCA mates go looking for him 
en|but are unable to find him as he's been captured by UBRI UBRI tricks Kal 
en|into believing that the male should lead as he had been indoctrinated into the matriarchal 
en|social mores of his people and he creates an alliance with Dr Hellegren to steal 
en|the Synchronium pieces that Neri and Mera have hidden in a secret cave While the 
en|primary cast gets new motivations by UBRI's move to ORCA and Kal's appearance on the 
en|island the secondary cast radically changes at the outset of the third season All of 
en|the original kids are replaced by a new crew and more adults are added to 
en|the ORCA staff As Neri begins her father's mission she is drawn farther and farther 
en|away from her island Beginning in the middle of the third season some episodes are 
en|primarily based on land By the fourth season some episodes are set in Egypt and 
en|her father's quest eventually leads her back to the "Ocean Planet" her home planet Most 
en|of the plots involving the secondary kids on ORCA are reduced in the final season 
en|in order to allow for greater exploration of Neri's homeworld Several new characters of Neri's 
en|species are introduced Likewise the threat of UBRI fades to be replaced by a new 
en|organization PRAXIS Preventative Response and eXtraterritorial Intelligence Service and by rebels on the Ocean Planet 
en|This group is dedicated to protecting against any threats posed by extraterrestrial life and it's 
en|agents comes to believe Neri and her people are a problem for Earth They thus 
en|chased Neri and the Bates boys around the world When a mysterious underwater pyramid is 
en|discovered in the ocean Neri and the Bates boys enter it and discover more about 
en|the Ocean Planet and Neri's mission on Earth When the rebellion in the Ocean World 
en|is growing Mera escapes to Earth and is reunited with Neri But PRAXIS sees this 
en|pyramid as a danger to the Earth Much of the final season is thus concerned 
en|with PRAXIS' attempt to attack the pyramid as well as with a "Red Virus" which 
en|is spreading in the oceans of Neri's homeworld the Ocean Planet Eventually in the series 
en|finale Jason Brett and Neri are able to repulse PRAXIS' efforts and the rebellion and 
en|Earth is saved Neri remains on Earth as the ambassador of the Ocean Planet and 
en|she and Jason finally become a couple The Bates family Winston Neri Charley and the 
en|ORCA computer HELEN Hydro Electronic Liaison ENtity are the only constant characters for the show's 
en|entire run However the part of Dr Bates is recast with Liz Burch after the 
en|second season Kerry Armstrong being committed workwise and HELEN is "upgraded" in the fourth and 
en|final season While Ocean Girl featured the ensemble cast listed above there were several characters 
en|who appeared for one season each with four children appearing in two seasons each three 
en|in Seasons and one in Seasons and as well as a few adults appearing in 
en|more than one season Most of the cast changes were explained by their "friends" or

en|An open mail relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP server configured in such 
en|a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send email through it not 
en|just mail destined to or originating from known This used to be the default configuration 
en|in many mail servers; indeed it was the way the Internet was initially set up 
en|but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms 
en|Many relays were closed or were placed on blacklists by other servers Until the mail 
en|servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact this was frequently the installation 
en|default The traditional store and forward method of relaying email to its destination required that 
en|it was passed from computer to computer through and beyond the Internet via modems on 
en|telephone lines For many early networks such as UUCPNET FidoNet and BITNET lists of machines 
en|that were open relays were a core part of those Filtering and speed of email 
en|delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational 
en|servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the 
en|transfer of commercial In the with the rise of spamming spammers resorted to rerouting their 
en|email through third party email servers to avoid and to exploit the additional resources of 
en|these open relay servers Spammers would send one email to the open relay and effectively 
en|include a large blind carbon copy list then the open relay would relay that spam 
en|to the entire While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time 
en|when Internet connections were limited it forced each spam to be an exact copy and 
en|thus easier to detect After abuse by spammers became widespread operating an open relay came 
en|to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent Open 
en|relays are recommended against in RFC and RFC which defines SMTP The exact copy nature 
en|of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk email detection systems such 
en|as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse To counter this spammers were forced to 
en|switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using 
en|open relays was removed since every copy of spam was "unique" and had to be 
en|sent individually Since open mail relays make no effort to authenticate the sender of an 
en|email open mail relays are vulnerable to address Many Internet service providers use Domain Name 
en|Systembased Blackhole Lists DNSBL to disallow mail from open relays Once a mail server is 
en|detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them they will be 
en|added to one or more such lists and other email servers using those lists will 
en|reject any mail coming from those sites The relay need not actually be used for 
en|sending spam to be blacklisted; instead it may be blacklisted after a vsimple test that 
en|just confirms open This trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays 
en|from over down to well under over several This led spammers to adopt other techniques 
en|such as the use of botnets of zombie computers to send spam One consequence of 
en|the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain 
en|Internet service providers To allow customers to use their email addresses at Internet locations other 
en|than the company's systems such as at school or work many mail sites explicitly allowed 
en|open relaying so that customers could send email via the ISP from any Once open 
en|relay became unacceptable because of abuse and unusable because of blocking of open relays ISPs 
en|and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail 
en|These include smart hosts SMTPAUTH POP before SMTP and the use of virtual private networks 
en|VPNs The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF has written a best current practices covering Email 
en|Submission Operations in RFC Note that the above only becomes an issue if the user 
en|wishes to or has to continue to send email remotely using the same SMTP server 
en|which they were previously accessing locally If they have valid access to some other SMTP 
en|server from their new remote location then they will typically be able to use that 
en|new server to send emails as if from their old address even when this server 
en|is properly secured Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's email client which 
en|may not be entirely straightforward The CANSPAM Act of makes it illegal to send spam 
en|through an open relay in the United States but makes no provision on their use 
en|for personal email or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been 
en|The most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John who argues 
en|that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue His server is included 
en|on many open relay blacklists many of which are generated by "automatic detection" that is 
en|by antispam blacklisters sending an unsolicited test email to other servers to see if they 
en|will be relayed These measures cause much of his outgoing email to be Along with 
en|his further deliberate configuration of the server his open relay enables people to send email 
en|without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send email anonymously

en|John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and 
en|spamming but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution 
en|of the new next generation technologies They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that 
en|some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past preventing transferring of 
en|computer data rather than In order not to be considered "open" an email relay should 
en|be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages details will vary 
en|from system to system — in particular further restrictions may well In particular a properly secured 
en|SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary emails from nonlocal IP addresses to 
en|nonlocal mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user In general any other rules an administrator 
en|chooses to enforce for instance based on what an email gives as its own envelope 
en|from address must be in addition to rather than instead of the If not the 
en|relay is still effectively open for instance by the above rules it is easy to 
en|forge email header and envelope information it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP 
en|address in a TCPIP transaction because of the threeway handshake that occurs as a connection 
en|is started Open relays have also resulted from security flaws in software rather than misconfiguration 
en|by system In these cases security patches need to be applied to close the relay 
en|Internet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose because spammers have 
en|created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability The number

en|Carnitine Oacetyltransferase also called carnitine acetyltransferase CRAT or EC is an enzyme that encoded by 
en|the CRAT gene that catalyzes the chemical reaction where the acetyl group displaces the hydrogen 
en|atom in the central hydroxyl group of Thus the two substrates of this enzyme are 
en|acetylCoA and carnitine whereas its two products are CoA and Oacetylcarnitine The reaction is highly 
en|reversible and does not depend on the order in which substrates Different subcellular localizations of 
en|the CRAT mRNAs are thought to result from alternative splicing of the CRAT gene suggested 
en|by the divergent sequences in the region of peroxisomal and mitochondrial CRAT cDNAs and the 
en|location of an intron where the sequences diverge The alternatively splicing of this gene results 
en|in three distinct isoforms one of which contains an Nterminal mitochondrial transit peptide and has 
en|been shown to be located in This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases to 
en|be specific those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups The systematic name of this 
en|enzyme class is acetylCoAcarnitine Oacetyltransferase Other names in common use include acetylCoAcarnitine Oacetyltransferase acetylcarnitine transferase 
en|carnitine acetyl coenzyme A transferase carnitine acetylase carnitine acetyltransferase carnitineacetylCoA transferase and CATC This enzyme 
en|participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism In general carnitine acetyltransferases have molecular weights of about 
en|kDa and contain approximately CRAT contains two domains an N domain and a C domain 
en|and is composed of α helices and β strands The N domain consists of an 
en|eightstranded β sheet flanked on both sides by eight α helices A sixstranded mixed β 
en|sheet and eleven α helices comprise the enzyme’s C domain When compared the cores of 
en|the two domains reflect significantly similar peptide backbone folding This occurs despite the fact that 
en|only of the amino acids that comprise those peptide backbones corresponds to one is the 
en|catalytic residue in It is located at the interface between the enzyme’s C and N 
en|domains towards the heart of CRAT is accessible via two Å channels that approach the 
en|residue from opposite ends of the CRAT enzyme These channels are utilized by the substrates 
en|of CRAT one channel for carnitine and one for CoA The side chain of is 
en|positioned irregularly with the ring nitrogen hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen on the amino 
en|acid Due to the fact that CRAT binds CoA rather than acetylCoA it appears that 
en|CRAT possesses the ability to hydrolyze acetylCoA before interacting with the lone CoA fragment at 
en|the binding CoA is bound in a linear conformation with its pantothenic arm binding at 
en|the active site Here the pantothenic arm’s terminal thiol group and the nitrogen on the 
en|catalytic side chain form a hydrogen bond The on CoA forms interactions with residues and 
en|Also at the binding site the residues and form a direct hydrogen bond to one 
en|another If either residue exhibits a mutation can result in a decrease in CRAT Carnitine 
en|binds to CRAT in a partially folded state with its hydroxyl group and carboxyl group 
en|facing opposite directions The site itself is composed of the C domain β sheet and 
en|particular residues from the N domain Upon binding a face of carnitine is left exposed 
en|to the space outside the enzyme Like CoA carnitine forms a hydrogen bond with the 
en|nitrogen on In the case of carnitine the bond is formed with its group This 
en|CRAT catalysis is stereospecific for carnitine as the stereoisomer of the group cannot sufficiently interact 
en|with the CRAT carnitine binding site CRAT undergoes minor conformational changes upon binding with The 
en|residue at the active site of CRAT acts as a base that is able to 
en|deprotonate the CoA thiol group or the Carnitine group depending on the direction of the 
en|reaction The structure of CRAT optimizes this reaction by causing direct hydrogen bonding between the 
en|and both substrates The deprotonated group is now free to attack the acetyl group of 
en|acetylCoA or acetylcarnitine at its carbonyl site The reaction proceeds directly without the formation of 
en|a intermediate It is possible for catalysis to occur with only one of the two 
en|substrates If either acetylCoA or acetylcarnitine binds to CRAT a water molecule may fill the 
en|other binding site and act as an acetyl group acceptor The literature suggests that the 
en|trimethylammonium group on carnitine may be a crucial factor in CRAT catalysis This group exhibits 
en|a positive charge that stabilizes the oxyanion in the reaction’s intermediate This idea is supported 
en|by the fact the positive charge of carnitine is unnecessary for active site binding but 
en|vital for the catalysis to proceed This has been proven to be the case through 
en|the synthesis of a carnitine analog lacking its trimethylammonium group This compound was able to 
en|compete with carnitine in binding to CRAT but was unable to induce a The emergence 
en|of subtrateassisted catalysis has opened up new strategies for increasing synthetic substrate There is evidence 
en|that suggests that CRAT activity is necessary for the cell cycle to proceed from the 
en|phase to the S Those with an inherited deficiency in CRAT activity are at risk 
en|for developing severe heart and neurological Reduced CRAT activity can be found in individuals suffering

en|Antonio Sartorio – December was an Italian composer active mainly in Venice Italy and in 
en|Hanover Germany He was a leading composer of operas in his native Venice in the 
en|and and was also known for composing in other genres of vocal music Between and 
en|he spent most of his time in Hanover where he held the post of Kapellmeister 
en|to Duke Johann Friedrich of BrunswickLüneburg – returning frequently to Venice to compose operas for 
en|the Carnival In he became vice maestro di capella at San Marco in Venice Sartorio 
en|was the brother of composer and organist Gasparo Sartorio and architect Girolamo Sartorio who also 
en|had connections with the theatre Beyond birth records the first known information about Sartorio relates 
en|to the mounting of his first opera Gl'amori infruttuosi di Pirro at the Teatro di 
en|San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice on January His second opera Seleuco did not come until 
en|five years later when it was produced at the Teatro San Luca on January The 
en|year before he had been appointed to the position of Kapellmeister to Duke Johann Friedrich 
en|of BrunswickLüneburg; just months after the duke had assumed authority over the Principality of Calenberg 
en|upon his elder brother Georg Wilhelm's inheriting of the Principality of Lüneburg Friedrich ruled over 
en|the Calenberg subdivision of the duchy from until his death in fourteen years later Friedrich 
en|was a highly intelligent and educated sovereign who had converted to Roman Catholicism in Upon 
en|becoming duke he instituted the Catholic rite to his court which accordingly led to his 
en|choice of Sartorio a Catholic as Kapellmeister The duke had met Sartorio upon one of 
en|his four visits to Italy one of which was for the purpose of lending the 
en|Republic of Venice substantial military aid against the Turks Sartorio began his duties as Kapellmeister 
en|on Trinity Sunday not too long after the Duke's new palace in Herrenhausen near Hanover 
en|was finished The palace's design was inspired by the Palace of Versailles and is famous 
en|for its gardens the Herrenhausen Gardens As Kapellmeister Sartorio had at his disposal six instrumentalists 
en|and seven or eight singers the majority of which were Italian For the group Sartorio 
en|composed music for the Kapelle a missa brevis and several vesper psalms and cantatas in 
en|both the stile antico and the stile moderno In addition the group's repertory included masses 
en|motets and psalms by Henri Dumont Bonifatio Gratiani and Orazio Tarditi Some of the group's 
en|music was discovered in in an organ bellows in the village of Hüpede Sartorio worked 
en|in Hanover up until during which time he returned frequently to Venice in the winter 
en|both to compose operas for Carnival and to hire musicians for service at court His 
en|first trip back to his native city was in During this time his remarkable duo 
en|operas La prosperità d'Elio Seiano and La caduta d'Elio Seiano were produced on January and 
en|February Originally the librettist Nicolò Minato had intended for the two works to be performed 
en|on successive evenings but it appears that either Sartorio or the theatre management overturned this 
en|decision Sartorio's second visit to Venice was for the Carnival of during which his next 
en|opera L'Ermengarda regina de' longobardi was performed The librettist Pietro Dolfin a friend of both 
en|Sartorio and Duke Johann Friedrich administered the duke's theatre loges and corresponded regularly with him 
en|between and Sartorio’s next stay in Venice lasted an entire year from January or February 
en|to Carnival On February his well known opera L'Adelaide was given for the first time 
en|The libretto was again by Dolfin who later reworked some of Gissilla's arias into a 
en|cantata by adding recitatives Sartorio seems to have responded to Dolfin's wish to have the 
en|recitatives set for a Cantata di Gissilla is extant; it was apparently conceived for a 
en|pupil of Dolfin's named Lucretia who had sung a role in the opera probably that 
en|of Gissilla Sartorio was supposed to return to Hanover at the end of the season 
en|in which L'Adelaide premiered but poor health prevented him from travelling He was further motivated 
en|to stay by an invitation to write one of two operas to be performed at 
en|the Teatro di San Luca during the next Carnival season The Duke assented to Sartorio's 
en|extended stay largely because of a lengthy and persuasive correspondence by Dolfin who expressed concerns 
en|over Sartorio's physical health and emphasized the honour of being asked to compose the opera 
en|Sartorio thereupon offered L'Orfeo a variation on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice with comic 
en|interludes and elaborate subplots featuring such incongruous characters as Hercules Achilles and Thetis This work 
en|premiered on December For the theatre's second opera of the season Francesco Cavalli was commissioned 
en|Cavalli was then near the end of a long and successful career as an operatic 
en|composer However when his newest work Massenzio went into rehearsal it was found unsuitable by 
en|the theatre managers "for lack of spirited ariettas" They therefore assigned Sartorio the task of 
en|writing his own music to the same libretto just days before the opera premiered on 
en|January Sartorio wrote arias and duets to fulfil his assignment After spending two more years 
en|in Hanover Sartorio left the service of Duke Johann Friedrich permanently in April although he 
en|still called himself Friedrich's court composer in the manuscripts of his remaining operas and in 
en|other documents Upon his departure the Duke gave him a gift of thalers and a 
en|golden chain The two men remained on good terms and corresponded often with each other 
en|about negotiations with singers or visits on his behalf to cloistered ladies Sartorio settled in 
en|Venice in taking up residence in the San Giovanni Grisostomo quarter of the city He 
en|won the position of vice maestro di cappella of the St Mark's Basilica narrowly defeating 
en|Carlo Grossi for the post and assuming his position there on May A set of 
en|eightpart psalms for two choirs that he wrote for the basilica were published in notably 
en|being his only printed volume of music On December his opera Giulio Cesare in Egitto 
en|premiered in Venice to a resounding success He composed four more operas between and Sartorio 
en|was supposed to have been visited by Duke Friedrich in early but the duke died 
en|on December in Augsburg at the start of his fifth journey to Italy Towards the 
en|end of Sartorio began composing another opera La Flora but he died before he could 
en|finish the work He had been ill for seven months prior to his death The 
en|Teatro San Angelo had commissioned La Flora and not wanting to give it up hired 
en|Marc'Antonio Ziani to finish it The opera was eventually performed at that house as the

en|The Nigerian political bureau of established by General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida shortly after his successful 
en|coup was one of the broadest political consultation exercises conducted in Nigerian history The bureau 
en|was headed by Dr Samuel Joseph Cookey and contained members charged with the responsibility of 
en|investigating the problems of the failed Nigerian political and democratic institutions collating the sociopolitical views 
en|of Nigerians and submitting remedies to curtail the perceived shortcomings of the political and economic 
en|Before the establishment of the bureau Nigeria had undergone two major democratic experiments replete with 
en|institutional failures However this did not quench the demand for a return to democracy after 
en|what was perceived as a relapse to authoritarian tendencies during the administration of General Muhammadu 
en|Buhari During the bureau's tenure it received over submissions from Nigerians all over the country 
en|on issues ranging from Religion to ethnicity and ideology At the end of its tenure 
en|the bureau submitted recommendations to the military governments However the political bureau was seen by 
en|some critics as an endeavor to legitimize the military's incursion to power by basing some 
en|of its existence to a return to democratic rule such as open debates and finalizing 
en|a return to democracy In Newswatch magazine released an unofficial report of the bureau for 
en|its reward it was proscribed for a few lending credence to some of the criticisms 
en|of the regime as taking Nigerian on a farcical democratic experiment General Babangida announced the 
en|names of the seventeen members of the Political Bureau at the inauguration of the bureau 
en|in Abuja on January The formation of the political bureau was a significant event for 
en|many reasons The composition of the bureau could hardly be faulted as it included men 
en|and women of character and learning; it also served as an early move for Babangida 
en|to coopt cultivate and involve intellectuals in the elaborate Transition to civil rule Programme In 
en|preparation Babangida released political detainees repealed the Decree of and promised a respect for fundamental 
en|human rights Within two years of seizing the reins of government Babangida had the support 
en|of a large swathe of the country; there were few dissensions When it started to 
en|be obvious to discerning members of the bureau that all was not well with Babangida's 
en|plans only a few of the members took decisive action Dr Edwin Madunagu then of 
en|the respected liberal newspaper The Guardian was dropped from the bureau for "extremist" and "uncooperative" 
en|views and attitudes He would later famously issue a separate report Reports appeared showing that 
en|Madunagu had been threatened and harassed Professor Sam E Oyovbaire served as special adviser to 
en|Admiral Aikhomu Aikhomu became Babangida's deputy after Commodore Ebitu Okoh Ukiwe had been forced out 
en|of office in October engaged in rationalising the regime's political programme Oyovbaire extolled the virtues 
en|of the Transition Programme the National Electoral Commission NEC MAMSER Mass Mobilisation for SelfReliance Social 
en|Justice and Economic Recovery SAP Structural Adjustment Programme the "homegrown" version implemented by the Babangida 
en|regime without the standby facility of the International Monetary Fund In February Oyovbaire along with 
en|Chidi Amuta wrote in defence of Babangida's In when Babangida had again nursed the ambition 
en|of contesting for the presidency Professor Oyovbaire had been named as his "Director of Policy 
en|and Strategy" In December when Badangida had been ruled out of the elections Oyovbaire had 
en|been reported as the head of the Abubakar Atiku campaign for the presidency in the 
en|SouthSouth; this followed the " harmonization process of the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Gusau Atiku and 
en|Saraki Campaign Teams in the SouthSouth following the adoption of Atiku Abubakar as the consensus 
en|Candidate by the Ciroma led wise men from the North These above appear to confirm 
en|the reading of public commentators including intellectuals and academics of the success of Babangida's patronage 
en|politics The creation of several programmes maintained a steady income for many academics even as 
en|the programs were rife with the corruption that marked Babangida's regime as exceptional Members of 
en|the political bureau were promised active roles in the implementation of their recommendations; personal loyalty 
en|developed as a matter of course In reference to the Transition Program of General Babangida 
en|Prof Adebayo Willians in "Intellectuals and the crisis of democratization in Nigeria Towards a theory 
en|of postcolonial anomie" wrote "A substantial faction of the intellectual class is implicated in this 
en|democratic debacle and its behaviour provides rich insights into the dynamics of intellectual affiliations in 
en|a neopatrimonial military state" By Oyovbaire could be read defending Babangida's regime "The socioeconomic reforms 
en|of the IBB regime created the enabling environment for a generation of Nigerian professionals who 
en|were selfreliant confident and challenged to break new grounds in the Nigerian political economy" and 
en|presented Babangida's regime as the " architect and founder of the process of modernization of 
en|the Nigerian political economy" Regarding the "missing" Billion Gulf War oilwindfall Oyovbaaire wrote "The IBB 
en|regime did what it had to do with the dedicated funds Therefore the divergence of 
en|opinions between the Okigbo committee and the IBB regime on this matter was essentially conceptual 
en|and not substantive" By Oyovbaire had become coordinator for the activities of PDP presidential aspirant 
en|Abubakar Atiku Oyovbaire has also coauthored a book "Portrait of a New Nigeria Leader Selected 
en|Speeches of IBB" Tunji Olagunju and Sam Oyovabaire In the preface Adele Jinadu wrote "President 
en|Babangida's enunciation of human rights as a cardinal aspect of his regime is not merely 
en|accidental or an opportunistic rationalisation to take advantage of the opprobrium in which the Buhari 
en|regime was held and thereby win popular acclaim Rather it runs deep in his liberal 
en|and populist convictions and is based on a reasoned and wellthought out conceptualisation of the 
en|military role in African politics" Jinadu another Nigerian intellectual appears blind to as Williams would 
en|write the "unprecedented and welldocumented assault on human rights by the Babangida government" Oyovbaire's high 
en|opinion of Babangida could be contrasted with the assessment of two other scholars In the

nl|gebouwen die populair waren onder andere fotografen waaronder Paleis te Rijswijk en de woning van

nl|De vorming van de Verenigde Staten van Oostenrijk was een politiek idee uit De bedoeling

nl|verschillende volkeren een eigen deelstaat geven Hoewel kroonprins Frans Ferdinand nooit officieel in het besturen 
nl|van de dubbelmonarchie OostenrijkHongarije werd betrokken werkte hij actief mee in de keizerlijke politiek Na 
nl|zijn troonsbestijging zou hij de naam Franz II aannemen Men wilde de modernisering van het 
nl|militaire apparaat forceren om de dubbelmonarchie te hervormen het zogenaamde trialisme De hervormingen zouden onder 
nl|meer Kroatië Bosnië en Dalmatië verenigen in één Kroatische deelstaat dit tot ergernis van Servië 
nl|dat ambities had een verenigd ZuidSlavisch koninkrijk onder Servische leiding te realiseren inclusief de Oostenrijkse 
nl|gebieden Kroatië Bosnië Dalmatië en Vojvodina Deze plannen zorgden derhalve voor Servische afkeer tegen Frans 
nl|Ferdinand en de Habsburgers Omgekeerd werd ook de afkeer van de OostenrijkHongaarse burgers en adel 
nl|tegen Servië groter Iets waar de officiële kranten in die tijd graag over schreven was 
nl|de agressieve opstelling van Servië Een veel gehoorde leuze in Oostenrijk in die tijd was 
nl|„Serviërs moeten sterven” Aurel Popovici een Roemeense politicus en jurist stelde in opdracht van Frans 
nl|Ferdinand een plan op van het nieuwe staatsbestel naar het voorbeeld van de Verenigde Staten 
nl|van Amerika de Verenigde Staten van GrootOostenrijk Men noemde dit het trialisme In elk geval 
nl|hadden deze plannen de staatsrechtelijke oplossing van de unie van Hongarije en Kroatië tot gevolg 
nl|gehad iets waar de Hongaren niet blij mee waren geweest Maar Franz Ferdinand ontpopte zich 
nl|daardoor wel tot een gevaarlijke tegenstander bij vele kringen van het hof en jaagde de 
nl|Hongaren en Serviërs tegen zich in het harnas Ondanks zijn hervormingsplannen werd hij nooit een 
nl|populair persoon ook niet in eigen land en bij zijn oom keizer Frans Jozef Het 
nl|trialisme beoogde voor alle volksgroepen autonomie in de vorm van een eigen deelstaat met een 
nl|eigen parlement Bij de oude staatsinrichting waren er maar twee deelstaten Cisleithanië Oostenrijk en Transleithanië 
nl|Hongarije Het gebied Bosnië behoorde tot geen van de landsdelen en werd centraal bestuurd als 
nl|bezet gebied op de kaart buiten het rijk Deze twee landsdelen bepaalden zelf de mate 
nl|van autonomie van de lagere bestuurseenheden De autonomie van de kroonlanden de gebieden van Oostenrijks 
nl|Cisleithanië was overal erg beperkt In Hongaars Transleithanië was de situatie ingewikkelder; vóór de Ausgleich 
nl|van was bijvoorbeeld Transsylvanië nog een gelijkberechtigd kroonland Alle gebieden inclusief Hongarije waren toen trouwens 
nl|nog kroonland die direct onder de centrale regering stonden Na de Ausgleich werd de term 
nl|kroonland in Hongarije afgeschaft De Ausgleich had dus tot gevolg dat Transsylvanië bij Transleithanië werd 
nl|ingedeeld Prompt deelden de Hongaren Transsylvanië in bij het koninkrijk Hongarije en niet als apart 
nl|koninkrijk of vorstendom zoals dat met Fiume en Kroatië en Slavonië wel gebeurde Uiteraard tot 
nl|groot ongenoegen van de daar wonende Roemenen Ook werd er door de Hongaren weleens getornd 
nl|aan de autonomie van de andere gebieden van Transleithanië zoals die van Kroatië Aan deze 
nl|situatie zouden de plannen van Frans Ferdinand een einde maken de twee landsdelen én de 
nl|kroonlanden en bestuurlijke gebieden van Transleithanië zouden vervangen worden door deelstaten met dezelfde bevoegdheden als

nl|De Voorhof is een woonwijk in Delft in de Nederlandse provincie ZuidHolland De wijk met 
nl|veel hoogbouw is een onderdeel van DelftZuid dat ten zuidwesten van het centrum van Delft 
nl|ligt De Voorhof is in de jaren gebouwd De woningdichtheid is door de flats hoog 
nl|De Voorhof is de dichtstbevolkte wijk van Delft en behoort ook tot de wijken van 
nl|Nederland met de meeste woningen per hectare VoorhofHoogbouw heeft een van de hoogste bevolkingsdichtheden van 
nl|Nederland Ongeveer is huurwoning koopwoning De Voorhof wordt aan de noordkant begrensd door de Westlandseweg 
nl|aan de zuidkant door de Kruithuisweg aan de westkant door de Beatrixlaan en aan de 
nl|oostkant door het spoor Midden in de buurt bevindt zich het winkelcentrum De Hoven Passage 
nl|Het hoge kantoorgebouw Torenhove met verdiepingen ligt aan dit winkelcentrum In de Voorhof wonen in 
nl|vergelijking met andere wijken veel mensen met een recente migratieachtergrond De Voorhof kan dus worden 
nl|gezien als een migrantenwijk Ongeveer de helft van de bevolking is van volledig Nederlandse afkomst 
nl|Er staan twee kerken in de Voorhof de Adelbertkerk en de Marcuskerk Een gedeelte van 
nl|Voorhof staat bekend als de Poptahof dat aan de noordzijde van de wijk ligt De 
nl|Poptahof wordt ingesloten door vier belangrijke wegen de Papsouwselaan Martinus Nijhofflaan Prinses Beatrixlaan en Westlandseweg 
nl|Winkelcentrum In de Hoven ligt tegen de Martinus Nijhofflaan aan De Poptahof is net zoals 
nl|de andere delen van de Voorhof in de jaren gebouwd Het bestaat hoofdzakelijk uit een 
nl|achttal flats met elf verdiepingen De woningen zijn vooral bestemd voor de huishoudens met lage 
nl|inkomens en bevat een hoge dichtheid aan verschillende nationaliteiten Opdracht tot de bouw van de 
nl|wijk werd gegeven door de toenmalige Algemene Woningbouwvereniging Volkshuisvesting AWV in Delft die de architect 
nl|SJ van Embden inhuurde om een woonbuurt te ontwikkelen in het toen populaire concept van 
nl|de Functionele Stad Hoogbouw deed daarmee zijn intrede in Delft De wijk die werd ontwikkeld 
nl|bestond uit ruim duizend woningen Die zijn verdeeld over acht flats van elf verdiepingen vier 
nl|middelhoge flats met vier verdiepingen en een aantal eengezinswoningen In de jaren werd besloten dat 
nl|de woningen in de hoge Poptahofflats niet meer voldeden en er kwamen er plannen voor 
nl|renovatie van de wijk De renovatie zou bestaan uit het creëren van meer open ruimte 
nl|door het slopen van de laagbouwflats en het volledig verbouwen van de hoogbouw De laagbouwflats 
nl|werden begin eeuw gesloopt Het strippen van de eerste hoogbouwflats zou aanvankelijk zo rond het 
nl|jaar beginnen en wel bij de voorste flats Na enkele jaren van uitstel onder meer 
nl|door protest van winkeliers onder de voorste flats van de Poptahof die vervangende winkelpanden eisten 
nl|in de periode dat de voorste flats zouden worden verbouwd werd er vanaf pas begonnen 
nl|met het ontruimen van de eerste flats voor de verbouwing Men begon daarbij uiteindelijk bij 
nl|de achterste flats In werd geschat dat de totale renovatie in zou worden afgerond Een 
nl|deel van de flats werd niet gerenoveerd waardoor de werkzaamheden al eerder in werden afgerond 
nl|Behalve de ingrijpende renovatie van de flats van de Poptahof werden er de jaren voor 
nl|en na nog andere grote werkzaamheden in de Voorhof uitgevoerd Om de verkeersdrukte voor auto's 
nl|te verminderen werd in en de Papsouwselaan opnieuw ingericht met in beide richtingen één rijstrook 
nl|voor auto's Aan de Papsouwselaan werd in een nieuwe parkeergarage gebouwd Deze was nodig voor 
nl|een eventuele uitbreiding van het winkelcentrum In de Hoven De parkeergarage en de herinrichting van 
nl|de Papsouwselaan passen in het kader van de renovatie van de wijk Het centrale verkeersplein 
nl|het Delflandplein werd opnieuw ingericht van een grote kruising tot een rond Op de Martinus 
nl|Nijhofflaan werd op de trambaan gras gelegd Station Delft Zuid werd aan het einde van 
nl|en in opnieuw ingericht Vanaf reed tramlijn tijdelijk niet meer door de Voorhof vanwege de 
nl|werkzaamheden aan de treintunnel door Delft De trams konden niet meer door de Irenetunnel Ongeveer 
nl|een jaar later werd het tramtraject opnieuw in gebruik genomen Xray is een nieuw complex 
nl|langs het spoor voor studentenhuisvesting Het werd aan het einde van geopend Er werden sinds 
nl|aan beide kanten van de Martinus Nijhofflaan nieuwe flats gebouwd met dezelfde architectuur van de

nl|laatst uitgezonden op in De serie was gericht op een jong publiek en was derhalve 
nl|ook educatief De hoofdrolspelers waren Sean Patrick Flanery Corey Carrier en George Hall Het succes 
nl|van de serie leidde tot de opnames van vier televisiefilms Tijdens de opnames van de 
nl|eerste drie bioscoopfilms over Indiana Jones kreeg regisseur George Lucas geregeld vragen van de cast 
nl|en crew over Indiana’s verleden Al in de derde film Indiana Jones and the Last 
nl|Crusade besloten Lucas en zijn collegaregisseur Steven Spielberg iets meer te onthullen over Indiana’s achtergrond 
nl|Zo bevat de film een scène waarin men een jonge Jones te zien krijgt gespeeld 
nl|door River Phoenix Dit leidde uiteindelijk tot het plan om meer films of een serie 
nl|te maken waarin Indiana Jones’s verleden zou worden uitgediept George Lucas schreef een uitgebreide tijdlijn 
nl|voor Indiana Jones waarin hij gedetailleerd gebeurtenissen uit Indiana’s jeugd vastlegde Deze tijdlijn vormde de 
nl|basis voor in totaal afleveringen De tijdlijn begon in en liep door tot aan Raiders 
nl|of the Lost Ark Lucas verwerkte in de tijdlijn ook al belangrijke zaken zoals welke 
nl|plaatsen Indiana zou bezoeken in welk jaar en welke historische personages hij zou ontmoeten Toen 
nl|de serie werd stopgezet waren nog maar van de geplande verhalen verteld Zou de serie 
nl|zijn voortgezet dan waren ook jongere versies van andere personages uit Raiders of the Lost 
nl|Ark geïntroduceerd zoals Abner Ravenwood "Jeruzalem Juni en René Belloq "Honduras December Een groot aantal 
nl|filmmakers werkten mee aan de serie waaronder bekende namen als Frank Darabont Nicolas Roeg Mike 
nl|Newell Deepa Mehta Joe Johnston Jonathan Hensleigh Terry Jones Simon Wincer Carrie Fisher en Vic 
nl|Armstrong De serie was ongewoon in het feit dat alle afleveringen op locatie werden gefilmd 
nl|overal ter wereld Om de kosten die dit met zich meebracht nog deels te reduceren 
nl|werd de serie opgenomen op film in plaats van het gebruikelijke De serie werd zo 
nl|opgenomen dat elke aflevering een opzichzelfstaand verhaal zou vormen en de afleveringen los van elkaar 
nl|te bekijken waren Elke aflevering kostte rond de miljoen dollar om te maken en opnames 
nl|duurden gemiddeld weken De serie werd in drie etappes opgenomen De eerste productie vond plaats 
nl|tussen en bestaande uit afleveringen Hiervan waren er vijf met Indy als kind met Indy 
nl|als tienerjonge volwassene en met allebei De tweede productie vond plaats van tot en bestond 
nl|uit afleveringen een met Indy als kind en met Indy als tienerjonge volwassene De derde 
nl|productie vond plaats van tm en bestond uit de vier televisiefilms De serie werd opgezet 
nl|als een educatief programma voor kinderen en tieners Derhalve hadden vaak historische personages of gebeurtenissen 
nl|een grote rol in de afleveringen De meeste afleveringen volgden een vaste formule waarin de 
nl|inmiddels Indiana Jones terugblikt op zijn jeugd en zijn belevenissen vertelt aan anderen De rest 
nl|van de aflevering toonde Indiana als een kind van een jaar of in de jaren 
nl|of als oudere tiener tijdens de jaren In een aflevering kwam een Indiana voor gespeeld 
nl|door Harrison Ford die ook de rol vertolkte in de vier bioscoopfilms In veel van 
nl|de afleveringen ontmoette Indiana een historisch figuur Zo kreeg men onder andere Leo Tolstoy Lawrence 
nl|of Arabia Theodore Roosevelt Jiddu Krishnamurti Pancho Villa Charles de Gaulle en John Ford te 
nl|zien De serie speelde zich af op verschillende locaties waaronder Egypte OostenrijkHongarije India en China 
nl|De show gaf veel achtergrondinformatie voor de reeds gemaakte films Zo werd Indiana’s relatie met 
nl|zijn vader die voor het eerst te zien was in Indiana Jones and the Last 
nl|Crusade verder uitgediept Ook Indiana’s jacht op het “Oog van de Pauw” een grote diamant 
nl|die te zien was in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was een regelmatig 
nl|terugkerende plot De serie bestaat uit seizoenen met in totaal afleveringen waarvan er niet zijn 
nl|uitgezonden Nadat de serie werd beëindigd werden er vier televisiefilms gemaakt als poging de serie 
nl|nieuw leven in te blazen In werden de afleveringen en televisiefilms bewerkt tot nieuwe afleveringen 
nl|verdeeld over periodes De naam werd aangepast naar The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones De

nl|Twee mannen waren van plan om het filiaal van het Grenswisselkantoor in Bladel te overvallen 
nl|Ze hadden allerlei voorbereidingen getroffen en zaten in hun auto te wachten op de komst 
nl|van de eerste bankemployee om toe te slaan als deze de deur van het bankkantoor 
nl|zou openen Deze man kreeg echter argwaan en waarschuwde de politie toen hij op de 
nl|parkeerplaats dezelfde auto zag staan als een dag eerder Toen de politie verscheen sloegen de 
nl|overvallers op de vlucht Na een wilde achtervolging werden ze ingerekend De voorbereidingen waren zeer 
nl|uitgebreid Verdachten reden in een gestolen auto met gestolen kentekenplaten naar het Grenswisselkantoor Daar stond 
nl|de auto met draaiende motor te wachten op komst van de bankemployee In hun auto 
nl|lag een geladen dubbelloops jachtgeweer een imitatie handvuurwapen alsook handboeien touw en tape om de 
nl|bankemployee te knevelen De mannen droegen dubbele kleding en hadden pruiken bij zich Uitvoeringshandeling Heeft 
nl|het voornemen van de daders om een misdrijf te plegen zich door een begin van 
nl|uitvoering geopenbaard Nee De vordering door de officier van justitie tot inbewaringstelling van een van 
nl|de twee verdachten werd door de rechtercommissaris afgewezen Deze beschikking is in hoger beroep door 
nl|de raadkamer van de rechtbank bevestigd Het cassatieberoep van de officier van justitie is door 
nl|de Hoge Raad verworpen De rechtbank overwoog dat niet is gebleken dat er sprake is 
nl|van enig begin van uitvoering nu verdachten in de auto zijn blijven zitten en geen 
nl|enkele verdere actie ter uitvoering van hun voornemen hebben ondernomen De Hoge Raad oordeelde dat 
nl|een begin van uitvoering van het voorgenomen misdrijf afpersing artikel Sr ontbrak Het voornemen van 
nl|de daders had zich niet door een begin van uitvoering geopenbaard Immers wanneer iemand het 
nl|voornemen heeft opgevat een bank te overvallen kan niet worden gezegd dat hij aan het 
nl|misdrijf begin van uitvoering heeft gegeven indien hij zich met een auto naar die bank 
nl|heeft begeven doch –om welke reden dan ook– die auto niet heeft verlaten noch –in 
nl|of vanuit die auto– een gedraging heeft verricht welke naar haar uiterlijke verschijningsvorm moet worden 
nl|beschouwd als te zijn gericht op de voltooiing van dat voorgenomen misdrijf De definitie van

nl|voorgenomen misdrijf aan te merken « als zij naar haar uiterlijke verschijningsvorm moet worden beschouwd als 
nl|te zijn gericht op de voltooiing van het misdrijf» Dit is het Citocriterium dat door 
nl|de Hoge Raad werd geïntroduceerd in het Citoarrest waarin een gedraging van de dader aanbellen 
nl|werd aangemerkt als begin van uitvoering waardoor het voornemen van de dader zich heeft geopenbaard 
nl|In de casus van het Grenswisselkantoorarrest zag de Hoge Raad géén begin van uitvoering zodat

nl|De bevolking bood geen weerstand maar vluchtte; derhalve werden de steden herbevolkt met Badense kolonisten

nl|een nieuw specimen IVPP aan de soort toegewezen bestaande uit de gedeeltelijke schedel en onderkaken 
nl|van een volwassen dier In de jaren daarna zijn verschillende andere vondsten gedaan die nog 
nl|onbeschreven zijn In stelde Paul Sereno dat Hongshanosaurus niet te onderscheiden viel van verschillende soorten

nl|dat Hongshanosaurus fylogenetisch in de soortengroep van Psittacosaurus valt De vaststelling in die zin door

nl|De politiekterritoriale ontwikkeling van de tot de eeuw van het graafschap Vlaanderen is vooral een 
nl|zaak geweest van de opeenvolgende Vlaamse graven Zij hebben zowel de interne consolidatie als de 
nl|externe expansie van het graafschap tot stand gebracht Het Vlaanderen van de eeuw heeft zijn 
nl|naam ontleend aan dit historische graafschap Het woord Vlaming is afgeleid van het Germaanse woord 
nl|flauma wat vloed betekent Wie in een gebied woonde dat onderhevig was aan overstromingen was 
nl|een flaumung De Romeinen noemden ze Flandrensis en de gouw Flandria De stap naar Vlaming 
nl|en Vlaanderen is dan nog Boudewijn I wordt als de eerste graaf van Vlaanderen beschouwd 
nl|Hij kwam vermoedelijk uit de streek van Laon en was de zoon van een zekere 
nl|Audacer Boudewijn heeft niets te maken met de fabuleuze “forestiers van Vlaanderen” ontsproten aan de 
nl|fantasie van overijverige middeleeuwse schrijvers Boudewijn kreeg de bijnaam “met de IJzeren Arm” door de 
nl|schaking in van Judith de dochter van koning Karel de Kale van WestFrancië Judith achterkleindochter 
nl|van Karel de Grote was door haar vader opgesloten in een toren te Soissons in 
nl|afwachting van een gouden kans op de huwelijksmarkt Met de hulp van kroonprins Lodewijk kon 
nl|ze ontsnappen in de armen van Boudewijn De koning was helemaal niet zinnens zijn dochter 
nl|uit te huwelijken aan de eerste de beste avonturier nadat ze al tweemaal een Engelse 
nl|koning tot echtgenoot had gehad Hij liet zijn bisschoppen de ban uitspreken over het koppel 
nl|Boudewijn en Judith vluchtten over de Alpen en zochten hun toevlucht bij paus Nicolaas I 
nl|Die koos dan de zijde van de geliefden en trachtte de koning te overhalen Boudewijn 
nl|dreigde er zelfs mee zich met de Noormannen te verbinden Uiteindelijk ging Karel de Kale 
nl|overstag Eind werd het huwelijk tussen Boudewijn en Judith gesloten Als gevolg van zijn huwelijk 
nl|met een Karolingische prinses werd Boudewijn beleend met enkele publieke functies Hij kreeg in de 
nl|gouwen Flandrensis rond Brugge Waas Kortrijk en bezat wellicht ook de gouw Gent zodat dit 
nl|een aangesloten geheel vormde Na verkreeg hij ook de Ternaasgouw Ternois met daarin geleden de 
nl|stad Terwaan Hij werd in begraven in de SintBertijnsabdij te SintOmaars die ook in deze 
nl|gouw lag Deze abdij zou later voor nog een aantal graven van Vlaanderen de laatste 
nl|rustplaats worden Tijdens de Franse Revolutie werden die graftomben vernield Men beschouwt Boudewijn I als 
nl|de laatste koninklijke ambtenaar binnen zijn familie Zijn erfgenamen zouden een veel zelfstandiger koers kunnen 
nl|varen omdat het koninklijke gezag in Parijs danig verzwakte onder meer door de invallen van 
nl|de Noormannen De dood van Boudewijn I in viel wellicht niet toevallig samen met nieuwe 
nl|invallen van de Noormannen in deze streek Pas in de zomer van vielen ze de 
nl|noordelijke pagus Flandrensis binnen om dan voor de winter het land te verlaten Boudewijn II 
nl|zoon van Boudewijn I is blijkbaar als gevolg van de Noormanneninval naar de noordelijker gelegen 
nl|pagus Flandrensis gevlucht Dit werd zijn nieuwe machtsbasis Wellicht hield Boudewijn II zich met zijn 
nl|familie schuil in de vesting van Brugge Hij zou de echte stichter van het graafschap 
nl|Vlaanderen worden Het hele gebied was verlaten; ook de ambtenaren en soldaten van de koning 
nl|waren vertrokken Voor koning Karloman van Frankrijk was het onmogelijk om het vlakke en door 
nl|vele rivieren doorkruiste Vlaanderen te verdedigen tegen de Noormannen Hij schoof de grens van zijn 
nl|rijk achteruit tot aan de Artesische heuvels richtte er een mark op en gaf die 
nl|in leen aan zijn verwant abt Rudolf die zo de Ternaasgouw Ternois en de abdijen 
nl|SintBertijns en SintVaast in zijn bezit kreeg Na het vertrek van de Noormannen kon Boudewijn 
nl|II het noordelijke gebied zonder slag of stoot tot het zijne verklaren en zo werd 
nl|hij heerser van een vorstendom dat van de Noordzee tot aan de heuvels van Artesië 
nl|reikte Zo ontstond in of kort daarop het zelfstandige graafschap Vlaanderen Boudewijns optreden werd niet 
nl|alleen vergemakkelijkt door het machtsvacuüm in het gebied als gevolg van de Noormanneninvallen maar ook 
nl|door de ineenstorting van de macht van de Franse koning Boudewijn maakte zich niet alleen 
nl|meester van enkele gouwen die eertijds aan zijn vader toebehoorden namelijk Waas Gent en Kortrijk 
nl|hij breidde dit ook uit met de noordelijker gelegen gouwen Vlaanderen Rodenburg en Mempiscus en 
nl|de vijf pagi tussen Leie en Schelde In stierf abtgraaf Rudolf Hierdoor kon Boudewijn II 
nl|de hand leggen op de Ternaasgouw met de abdij van SintBertijns en op de stad 
nl|Atrecht met de abdij van SintVaast Nog in hetzelfde jaar maakte hij zich ook meester 
nl|van de gouwen Vermandois Bonen Boulogne en Artesië Artois De koning Odo I van Frankrijk 
nl|kon dit niet laten gebeuren en er kwam oorlog van In kwamen de beide mannen 
nl|tot een akkoord Boudewijn II deed afstand van Vermandois maar behield Bonen en Artesië Boudewijn 
nl|II deed in echter opnieuw een poging om SintKwintens SaintQuentin de hoofdstad van Vermandois te 
nl|veroveren Maar de koning rukte met zijn leger binnen en sloeg het beleg voor Atrecht 
nl|dat spoedig in zijn handen viel Hierdoor verloor Boudewijn II de hele gouw Artesië met 
nl|de rijke SintVaastabdij Boudewijn zag na deze rampzalige oorlog tegen koning Karel III in dat 
nl|verder strijden niet veel zin meer had en hij is zich meer gaan toeleggen op 
nl|de interne bevestiging van zijn macht in zijn graafschap Hij beschikte bovendien over een reusachtig 
nl|domein dat hij verworven had door zich na de aftocht van de Noormannen de grondeigendommen 
nl|van de Kerk de koning en misschien ook van grootgrondbezitters toe te eigenen Bovendien had 
nl|hij als vorst het recht op de woeste en braakliggende gronden Om zijn land beter 
nl|te kunnen verdedigen tegen volgende invallen van Noormannen heeft hij reeds vanaf een aantal vestingen 
nl|laten optrekken langs de kustlijn namelijk te Oostburg Aardenburg Brugge Oudenburg Gistel Veurne Broekburg en 
nl|SintWinoksbergen maar ook binnenlands onder andere in Gent en Kortrijk Boudewijn II stierf in Na 
nl|het overlijden van Boudewijn II werd zijn vorstendom verdeeld onder zijn twee zonen Arnulf kreeg 
nl|de gebieden waarover zijn vader vrijwel onmiddellijk regeerde namelijk de streek tussen de Noordzee de 
nl|Schelde en de Artesische heuvels Vanaf dan werd de naam Vlaanderen voor dit hele gebied 
nl|gebruikt Tot het erfdeel van de jongere zoon Adalolf behoorden de later veroverde gebieden dit 
nl|zijn de gouwen Bonen en Ternaas Wellicht behield Arnulf als oudste zoon een soort soevereiniteit 
nl|over de gebieden van zijn broer Ondanks al zijn inspanningen heeft Boudewijn II geen gaaf 
nl|vorstendom kunnen nalaten Vlaanderen zou pas zijn natuurlijke grenzen bereiken met het bezit van de 
nl|gouwen Artesië Artois Ponthieu en Oosterbant Ostrevent Artesië zou dan een sterke bareel zijn tegen 
nl|de invallen uit het zuiden terwijl de hoofdplaats van Ponthieu Montreuil de enige oversteekplaats was 
nl|over de rivier de Kwinte Canche de zuidgrens van Vlaanderen Ten slotte zou met het 
nl|bezit van Oosterbant de Schelde overal bereikt worden In de verwarring ontstaan door de strijd 
nl|om de oppermacht in Frankrijk kon Arnulf I in de hand leggen op Mortagne de 
nl|tweede vesting van Oosterbant Het jaar daarop in stierf de gouwgraaf van Artesië Adelelm en 
nl|daarvan maakte Arnulf gebruik om diens hele gouw met de SintVaastabdij in te palmen Iets 
nl|later viel ook de hoofdstad van Oosterbant Dowaai samen met de rest van de gouw 
nl|in handen van Arnulf In overleed zijn broer Adalolf en daarop maakte Arnulf zich meester 
nl|van diens bezit namelijk de gouwen Bonen en Ternaas Hierdoor ontzegde hij wel de zonen 
nl|van Adalolf hun erfdeel In kon de Karolinger Lodewijk IV van Overzee bezit nemen van 
nl|de troon in Frankrijk Hij moest hiervoor vanuit Engeland via Bonen naar zijn nieuw koninkrijk 
nl|reizen Deze eerste ontmoeting schijnt de aanzet te zijn geweest voor een lange vriendschap tussen 
nl|graaf Arnulf en Lodewijk Het is in die tijd dat Arnulf de titel van markgraaf 
nl|aanneemt; waarschijnlijk werd hij door de koning met deze waardigheid vereerd Enige tijd later braken 
nl|er conflicten uit met graafschap Normandië en graaf en vikingkoning Willem I van Normandië De 
nl|stad Montreuil werd heen en weer veroverd maar zonder definitief resultaat voor de Vlamingen De 
nl|stad was zo belangrijk omdat het de enige oversteekplaats was voor een leger over de 
nl|Kwinte; uitgestrekte moerassen maakten dit verderop onmogelijk Montreuil was dus de sleutel van de zuidgrens 
nl|van Vlaanderen en van de noordgrens van Normandië Pas in verkreeg Arnulf deze stad door 
nl|een schenking van de machtigste edelman van Frankrijk hertog Hugo die hoopte hiermee de steun 
nl|van de graaf voor zich te winnen Dit lukte evenwel niet integendeel toen er een 
nl|opstand losbrak tegen Hugo kon Arnulf Amiens op hem veroveren In de jaren stond Arnulf 
nl|I op het hoogtepunt van zijn regering Hij had Vlaanderen tot aan de Somme uitgebreid 
nl|en er heerste rust in het land De enkele moeilijkheden die zich voordeden liet hij 
nl|aan zijn zoon Boudewijn over die hij graaf schijnt gemaakt te hebben van de zuidelijke 
nl|gouwen van Vlaanderen Deze laatste wordt meestal aangeduid onder de benaming Boudewijn III maar hij 
nl|is nooit graaf van Vlaanderen geweest hoogstens medegraaf onder Arnulf I Boudewijn III sterft namelijk 
nl|in en laat enkel een minderjarige zoon Arnulf achter De zonen van Adalolf de overleden 
nl|broer van Arnulf I grepen hun kans om het erfdeel van hun vader op te 
nl|eisen en kwamen in opstand Graaf Arnulf I begreep dadelijk dat zijn verwanten zijn kleinzoon 
nl|zouden behandelen zoals hij met zijn neven had gedaan Hij zag zijn levenswerk verloren gaan 
nl|wanhopig liet hij een van hen om het leven brengen in de hoop de ander 
nl|schrik aan te jagen Maar integendeel deze ging nu nog feller te keer Daarom zocht 
nl|hij zijn toevlucht tot een laatste redmiddel om althans een deel van zijn vorstendom voor 
nl|zijn kleinzoon te bewaren Hij ging naar zijn opperleenheer de Franse koning Lotharius van Frankrijk 
nl|en ze kwamen tot een akkoord Wanneer Arnulf stierf zou Lotharius al diens veroverde gebieden 
nl|krijgen namelijk Amiens Ponthieu Artesië en Oosterbant In ruil daarvoor zou Lotharius voogd worden van 
nl|de jonge Arnulf tijdens diens minderjarigheid en ervoor zorgen dat Arnulf erkend zou worden als 
nl|graaf in de rest van Vlaanderen Tevens moest ook Boudewijn Baldzo wellicht een zoon van 
nl|Arnulf I’s oom Rudolf waken over de kleine Arnulf De overgebleven zoon van Adalolf ook 
nl|een Arnulf zou het erfdeel krijgen van zijn vader namelijk de gouwen Bonen en Ternaas 
nl|De oude graaf Arnulf I overleed in Zoals Arnulf I voorzien had volgde na zijn 
nl|dood een totale ineenstorting van het grafelijk gezag Lotharius hield zich nog aan het akkoord 
nl|deed Arnulf II als graaf erkennen en eigende zich de zuidelijke gebieden van Vlaanderen toe 
nl|Edellieden beschouwden echter hun lenen als hun eigendom en usurpeerden de grafelijke rechten Arnulf II’s 
nl|zogezegde beschermer Boudewijn Baldzo maakte zich meester van een eigen graafschap Kortrijk Dirk II van 
nl|Holland graaf van WestFriesland en aangetrouwde oom van Arnulf II werd graaf van Gent en 
nl|Waas Arnulf de zoon van Adalolf nam wat hem van rechtswege toekwam en werd graaf 
nl|van Bonen en Ternaas Arnulf II stelde zich tevreden met wat er van zijn graafschap 
nl|overbleef de streek tussen de Leie en de zee en met zijn theoretisch leenheerlijk gezag 
nl|over de graafschappen die Dirk van WestFriesland en Arnulf van Bonen hadden verkregen Vroeger al 
nl|had een groep Vikingen zich onder leiding van Siegfried van Denemarken hoewel deze figuur ook 
nl|legendarisch kan zijn gevestigd in het Boonse aan de Noordzeekust Wellicht trouwde hij met een 
nl|dochter van Arnulf I en hun zoon Adolf verkreeg van Arnulf II de titel van 
nl|graaf van Gizene Guînes Na de dood van Arnulf van Bonen werd diens graafschap verdeeld 
nl|onder zijn twee zonen de ene kreeg Bonen de andere Ternaas Verderop in Vlaanderen werd 
nl|Boudewijn Baldzo in het grootste gedeelte van het graafschap Kortrijk opgevolgd door Eilbodo terwijl het 
nl|noordelijke gebied wellicht gevoegd werd bij het vorstendom van de graaf van WestFriesland Arnulf II 
nl|was een zwak vorst en toen hij stierf in zag de toekomst er niet rooskleurig 
nl|uit voor zijn geslacht Niet alleen was Vlaanderen sterk ineengekrompen bovendien kwam opnieuw een minderjarige 
nl|graaf op de troon ditmaal Boudewijn IV Het geslacht der Baldwinen zou zich echter herpakken 
nl|Ze kregen hierbij zelfs een steuntje in de rug van de overmoedige Capetingers Hugo Capet 
nl|had zich wel meester kunnen maken van de Franse kroon rijk was hij echter niet 
nl|Wat hij nodig had was een groot vorstendom dat de luister van zijn dynastie zou 
nl|verhogen Hij liet zijn oog vallen op Vlaanderen en regelde een huwelijk tussen zijn jonge 
nl|zoon Robrecht met Suzanna de weduwe van Arnulf II Zolang Boudewijn IV minderjarig bleef zou 
nl|Robrecht er het grafelijk gezag uitoefenen en het graafschap misschien wel kunnen behouden Hugo was 
nl|tot zware offers bereid en liet Artesië Oosterbant en Ponthieu voor Suzanna vastleggen Maar het 
nl|draaide anders uit Reeds na enkele jaren werd de rijpe bijna oude Suzanna verstoten door 
nl|de jonge en lichtzinnige Robrecht De Franse koning weigerde echter de beloofde gebieden aan Suzanna 
nl|te geven De Vlamingen lieten het hier niet bij en er kwam oorlog van Uiteindelijk 
nl|werd deze beslecht met een akkoord waarbij Artesië en Oosterbant definitief aan Vlaanderen werden gegeven 
nl|terwijl Ponthieu met Montreuil aan de kroon bleef Boudewijn IV was inmiddels volwassen en vastbesloten 
nl|het weggekwijnde grafelijk gezag in Vlaanderen te herstellen Hij beroofde Eilbodo van Kortrijk van diens 
nl|onwettige gezag en toen Arnulf graaf van WestFriesland in sneuvelde en alleen een jonge zoon 
nl|naliet kon Boudewijn de graafschappen Gent en Waas terug onder zijn rechtstreeks gezag plaatsen Dat 
nl|gebeurde niet met de zuidelijke graafschappen waarvoor hij zich tevreden stelde met de erkenning van 
nl|zijn leenheerschappij Het Graafschap Ternaas was verder uiteengevallen het noordelijke deel met de steden Ariën 
nl|Aire en SintOmaars keerde terug naar het graafschap Vlaanderen het zuidelijke deel bleef zelfstandig onder 
nl|de naam Graafschap SaintPol Graafschap SintPols maar verloor later nog het zuiden van zijn grondgebied 
nl|dat het graafschap Hesdin Graafschap Heusden werd De Vlaamse graaf was dus leenman van de 
nl|Franse koning voor het markgraafschap Vlaanderen en op zijn beurt leenheer van de graven van 
nl|Bonen Gizene SintPols en later nog Hesdin Ook intern wilde Boudewijn IV zijn gezag versterken 
nl|Om een steviger greep krijgen op zijn eigen binnenland begon hij in met de reorganisatie 
nl|van de Vlaamse gewesten Het graafschap Vlaanderen werd namelijk ingedeeld in vrij grote gewestelijke eenheden 
nl|kasselrijen of burggraafschappen genaamd Elk burggraafschap was als het ware gericht op een centrale grafelijke 
nl|burcht De oudste waren Brugge Gent Doornik en SintOmaars De onderliggende gouwen bleven zichtbaar sommigen 
nl|werden echter afgeschaft zoals de Mepsegouw terwijl andere hun eigenheid hebben weten te bewaren zoals 
nl|het Land van Waas en het Land van Pévèle met Pevelenberg Grootste vernieuwing was dat 
nl|de bruggraaf wel zijn ambt in leen hield maar niet meer de grafelijke burcht en 
nl|het territorium De edelen die hij opriep en leidde bleven krijgers van de graaf Hij 
nl|was echter geen beroepsambtenaar die zoals de baljuw later zomaar door de graaf verplaatst of 
nl|afgezet kon worden Met de instelling van burggraafschappen legde Boudewijn IV een steviger fundering onder 
nl|het grafelijk gezag Toen dit gerealiseerd was kon hij zich gaan concentreren op territoriale expansie 
nl|In het zuiden had het Normandische blok zich nog uitgebreid en werd het slechts door 
nl|Ponthieu van Vlaanderen gescheiden Verdere expansie van Vlaanderen naar het zuiden was dus niet meer 
nl|mogelijk Boudewijn IV richtte zijn blik naar het oosten naar het hertogdom NederLotharingen waar de 
nl|keizerlijke macht aan het verzwakken was Daar probeerden de voornaamste graven hun gebied uit te 
nl|breiden ten koste van de bisschoppen en de keizer Er was echter één hinderpaal voor 
nl|Vlaanderen Om een inval vanuit het westen te verhinderen hadden de keizers een aantal marken 
nl|opgericht op de rechteroever van de Schelde Dit waren van zuid naar noord de mark 
nl|Valencijn de mark Ename en de mark Antwerpen Indien Boudewijn IV wilde slagen in zijn 
nl|uitbreidingspolitiek zou hij eerst deze keizerlijke burchtenlinie moeten breken Om echter een inval vanuit Lotharingen 
nl|in Vlaanderen te verhinderen organiseerde of voltooide hij ook een gordel van burchten langs de 
nl|Schelde namelijk in Gent Oudenaarde en Doornik Boudewijn IV begon met de meest zuidelijke vesting 
nl|Valencijn Rond was hij al in een oorlog verwikkeld met Arnulf de keizerlijke markgraaf in 
nl|de streek van Valencijn In kon Boudewijn zich meester maken van Valencijn Een belegering door 
nl|een brede coalitie tussen de Duitse keizer Keizer Hendrik II de Heilige de koning van 
nl|Frankrijk Robert II en de hertog van Normandië Richard II van Normandië kon hem niet 
nl|op de knieën krijgen maar een verwoestende inval in Vlaanderen door Duitse troepen kon dat 
nl|wel Boudewijn moest Valencijn terug afstaan In maakte hij echter gebruik van de dood van 
nl|graaf Arnulf van Valencijn om de stad opnieuw te bezetten Keizer Hendrik II kon de 
nl|steun van de Vlaamse graaf wel gebruiken tegen een opstand van Lotharingse edelen en hoopte 
nl|deze dan ook te verkrijgen door Boudewijn niet alleen te erkennen als graaf van Valencijn 
nl|maar hem ook nog Walcheren met de bijbehorende Zeeuwse eilanden en de latere Vier Ambachten 
nl|te schenken Boudewijn IV had vaste voet gekregen aan de rechteroever van de Schelde en 
nl|bovendien was hij nu zowel vazal van de Franse koning voor KroonVlaanderen als van de 
nl|Duitse keizer voor RijksVlaanderen Rond is hij weer in oorlog met de Franse koning Robert 
nl|II Om zijn Lotharingse politiek te kunnen verderzetten besefte Boudewijn dat hij vrede moest zien 
nl|te sluiten met de koning van Frankrijk Ze kwamen tot het akkoord dat Boudewijns zoon 
nl|de latere Boudewijn V zou huwen met Adela de jongste dochter van de koning Zij 
nl|werd voortaan aan het Vlaamse hof opgevoed Deze verbintenis tussen het koninklijk huis en de 
nl|grafelijke dynastie van Vlaanderen zou honderd jaar bijna ononderbroken vrede tussen Vlaanderen en Frankrijk tot 
nl|gevolg hebben Maar de latere Boudewijn V voelde zich nu zo verheven dat hij niet 
nl|langer wilde wachten op zijn vaders dood om hem te kunnen opvolgen Met een deel 
nl|van de adel achter zich kwam hij in opstand Boudewijn IV moest zelfs zijn toevlucht 
nl|zoeken bij de hertog van Normandië Robert de Duivel Hij wist met de hulp van 
nl|de Normandiër zijn zoon op de knieën te krijgen en uiteindelijk verzoenden vader en zoon 
nl|zich terug met elkaar Boudewijn IV kon zich nu richten op Ename In namen de 
nl|Vlamingen de burcht van Ename in en staken die in brand De graaf die in 
nl|stierf haalde dus niet alleen het grafelijk gezag uit de crisis maar slaagde er ook 
nl|nog in het graafschap Vlaanderen uit te breiden Hij putte zich niet uit in wanhopige 
nl|pogingen om Ponthieu te herwinnen maar stelde zich tevreden met Artesië waarmee Vlaanderen zijn historische 
nl|en aardrijkskundige grenzen bereikte Uitbreiding zag Boudewijn wel mogelijk in oostelijke richting en met Walcheren 
nl|en de andere eilanden van Zeeland Bewestenschelde de Vier Ambachten Ename en Valencijn had hij 
nl|de ijzeren ring die Vlaanderens expansie moest beletten doen springen Boudewijn V maakte het werk 
nl|van zijn vader in het land tussen Schelde en Dender af De Vlamingen konden zich 
nl|in vanuit Ename ook meester maken van de hele mark Ename Bovendien verkreeg Boudewijn van 
nl|de Duitse keizer Keizer Hendrik III voor zijn zoon ook nog het markgraafschap Antwerpen Hiermee 
nl|leek Vlaanderen wel volledig uit zijn voegen te zijn gebarsten maar het was een vergiftigd 
nl|geschenk De keizer hoopte met zijn daad Boudewijns steun te verwerven in zijn oorlog tegen 
nl|zijn opstandige vazal Godfried hertog van OpperLotharingen en diens bondgenoot de Franse koning Hendrik I 
nl|van Frankrijk Toch schaarde Boudewijn zich uit louter politiek belang bij de vijanden van de 
nl|keizer Maar de Franse koning en de Duitse keizer verzoenden zich met elkaar De Engelse 
nl|en Deense koningen Eduard de Belijder en Sven II van Denemarken organiseerden een blokkade van 
nl|de Vlaamse kust en een keizerlijke militaire overmacht dwong Boudewijn tot onderwerping Boudewijn verloor het 
nl|markgraafschap Antwerpen en bovendien behield hij alleen het noordelijke deel van de mark Ename terwijl 
nl|Valencijn en het zuiden van de mark Ename onder graafschap Henegouwen kwamen Maar Boudewijn V 
nl|gaf niet op In mei overleed graaf Herman van Henegouwen en diens weduwe Richilde nam 
nl|het beheer over Boudewijn kon een huwelijk forceren tussen haar en zijn zoon de latere 
nl|Boudewijn VI zonder dat de vereiste keizerlijke instemming was gevraagd Een strafexpeditie tegen Vlaanderen haalde 
nl|niets uit en uiteindelijk kregen Richilde en de jonge Boudewijn Boudewijn I voor de Henegouwers 
nl|in de keizerlijke investituur van Henegouwen De rechten van de kinderen van Herman van Henegouwen 
nl|werden hiermee aan de kant geschoven Boudewijn V kon bovendien ook voor zijn andere kinderen 
nl|succesvolle huwelijken sluiten Robrecht huwde in met Geertrui weduwe van de graaf van Holland Floris 
nl|I van Holland waardoor hij in dat graafschap het bewind kon voeren in naam van 
nl|zijn nog onmondige stiefkinderen Mathilde trouwde waarschijnlijk in met Willem de Veroveraar hertog van Normandië 
nl|die in bezit kon nemen van Engeland Mathilde werd in mei te Westminster gekroond en 
nl|gezalfd tot koningin van Engeland De Vlaamse graaf zette ook de gewestelijke reorganisatiepolitiek van zijn 
nl|vader verder ten gunste van de interne consolidering van de grafelijke macht Het aantal burggraafschappen 
nl|werd nog uitgebreid door een aantal ondergeschikte ressorten of ambachten los te maken uit een 
nl|ouder burggraafschap Boudewijn V kondigde in samen met de bisschop van Terwaan Drogo van Terwaan 
nl|een godsbestand af in zijn land dit betekende dat op er niet mocht gevochten worden 
nl|op bepaalde dagen Zo zorgde de graaf voor de pacificatie van zijn land en verwierf 
nl|hij zo bovendien het alleenrecht op oorlogvoering Boudewijn V stierf in en werd opgevolgd door 
nl|zijn oudste zoon Boudewijn VI Om de vrede te bewaren na zijn overlijden had Boudewijn 
nl|V voor zijn jongere zoon Robrecht de Fries een zeer ambitieus figuur een vorstendom buiten 
nl|Vlaanderen gezocht Hij werd zoals reeds vermeld uitgehuwd aan de weduwe van de graafschap Holland 
nl|Bovendien moest Robrecht dadelijk na zijn huwelijk afstand doen van al zijn rechten op de 
nl|opvolging in Vlaanderen Met Boudewijn VI kwam een personele unie tot stand tussen het graafschap 
nl|Vlaanderen en het graafschap Henegouwen wellicht hoopte hij op termijn ook een structurele eenheid te 
nl|kunnen verwezenlijken zodat hij over een nog machtiger bolwerk zou regeren tussen Frankrijk en het 
nl|Duitse rijk Maar die plannen werden echter doorkruist door zijn vroegtijdig overlijden in Hij had 
nl|slechts drie jaar geregeerd over Vlaanderen; zijn nog heel jonge zoon Arnulf III zou het 
nl|er nog slechter vanaf brengen Nu rook Robrecht de Fries zijn kans Hij had een 
nl|aanzienlijke machtspositie opgebouwd in het noorden en wilde maar al te graag het belangrijke graafschap 
nl|Vlaanderen verwerven Hij moedigde een opstand aan tegen Arnulf III en diens moeder Richilde Robrecht 
nl|slaagde erin een aantal steden en een belangrijk deel van de Vlaamse ridderschap vooral uit 
nl|het noordelijke Dietstalige gebied van het graafschap voor zich te winnen en hij viel Vlaanderen 
nl|binnen Vlaanderen kende zijn eerste grote burgeroorlog Arnulf III kreeg de steun van een grote 
nl|coalitie tegen Robrecht bestaande uit zijn leenheer de Franse koning Filips I van Frankrijk zijn 
nl|oom Willem de Veroveraar echter slechts tien Normandische ridders de graaf van Leuven Hendrik II 
nl|van Leuven en de overwegend Romaanstalige heren uit het zuiden Arnulf werd echter verslagen in 
nl|de slag bij Kassel op februari en verloor er het leven Robrecht werd in Vlaanderen 
nl|als graaf erkend terwijl Richilde en haar tweede zoon Boudewijn genoegen moesten nemen met het 
nl|graafschap Henegouwen Nauwelijks een maand na de nederlaag trok Richilde met een gezamenlijk Henegouws en 
nl|Frans leger opnieuw ten strijde tegen Robrecht de Fries SintOmaars werd geplunderd en platgebrand Robrecht 
nl|onderhandelde via de door hem gevangengenomen Eustaas I van Boulogne met zijn broer Godfried bisschop 
nl|van Parijs en kanselier van Filips I Godfried onderhandelde een vredesakkoord Filips I gaf geen

nl|Rallycross in Nederland ook wel Rallyracing genoemd is een autosport Rallycross wordt op permanente circuits 
nl|van circa kilometer lang gereden minimum maximum meter Die circuits zijn deels verhard deels onverhard 
nl|In principe geldt dat minstens verhard moet zijn en minstens onverhard maar uitzonderlijk worden ook 
nl|autocrosscircuits gebruikt volledig onverhard op voorwaarde dat de startgrid wel van asfalt of beton is 
nl|bijvoorbeeld de baan "Am Matschenberg" die af en toe gebruikt wordt voor het Duits kampioenschap 
nl|en het Circuit André Toton dat enkele keren op de Franse rallycrosskalender stond Typisch voor 
nl|veel circuits is ook de aparte startstrook dat wil zeggen dat de startplaats in het 
nl|verlengde ligt van een rechte lijn of grote bocht zodat de volgende starters zich al 
nl|kunnen opstellen terwijl de vorige nog aan het racen zijn Meestal bevindt de finish zich 
nl|ook op die rechte lijn of in de bocht net voor de piloten er terug 
nl|op komen Vanaf de finish mogen de piloten niet rechtdoor terug het rennerskwartier in kunnen 
nl|rijden zodat ze dat zeker niet met volle snelheid doen De eerste meter vanaf de 
nl|start moeten zeker verhard zijn en tot de eerste bocht moet de afstand minstens meter 
nl|bedragen Het circuit moet overal tot meter breed zijn en van de start minimumbreedte per 
nl|starter + minstens een halve meter aan elke kant tot de baanrand tot de eerste 
nl|bocht mag er zeker geen versmalling zijn De voor internationale wedstrijden herkende circuits bezitten een 
nl|zogenaamde Joker Lap sektie lap = ronde een iets tragere variant bijvoorbeeld een stuk onverhard 
nl|buitenom een geheel of deels verharde bocht die de piloten in elke reeks en finale 
nl|één keer moeten nemen maar ze mogen zelf kiezen in welke ronde Deze ronde wordt 
nl|dan hun Joker Lap genoemd Tijdens de vrije training mag de Joker Lap gereden worden 
nl|tijdens de tijdtraining wordt aan de Joker Lap sektie voorbijgereden Een Joker Lap moet minstens 
nl|twee seconden langer duren dan een normale ronde Om de veiligheid te garanderen moet de 
nl|snelheid van de piloten die het 'normale' circuit voor hun Joker Lap verlaten ongeveer even 
nl|hoog kunnen zijn als die van de piloten die zich op die plek op het 
nl|'normale' circuit bevinden De breedte is maximaal Veel circuits bezitten ook een chicane een iets 
nl|smallere en soms vrij scherpe bocht Vaak kan deze zeker als ze op de eerste 
nl|rechte lijn ligt zie boven minimumafstand en breedte tot eerste bocht in de eerste ronde 
nl|gewoon rechtdoor voorbijgereden worden bijvoorbeeld op het Eurocircuit in Valkenswaard De hier vermelde cijfers komen 
nl|uit de reglementen van de FIA de Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile en zijn dus niet 
nl|per definitie op alle circuits van toepassing waar geen door de FIA georganiseerde kampioenschappen doorgaan 
nl|Zo bedroeg de minimumbreedte volgens de AFORreglementen Frankrijk tot voor enkele jaren slechts meter nu 
nl|breedte en is het minimum onverhard volgens de KNAFreglementen Nederland en de minimumafstand tot de 
nl|eerste onverharde strook Eerst krijgen de piloten de kans om enkele rondjes te rijden om 
nl|met het circuit en zijn toestand vertrouwd te raken meestal rondjes; bij wedstrijden over twee 
nl|dagen bijvoorbeeld voor het EK begint de tweede dag ook met een "warm up" van 
nl|rondjes vrije training Na deze vrije training is er de tijdtraining de piloten rijden individueel 
nl|rondjes Van de tweede en de derde wordt de tijd gemeten en aan de hand 
nl|van het beste resultaat wordt de startvolgorde voor de eerste reeks bepaald Daarbij starten de 
nl|wagens per of van onderaan geteld per tot er of minder overblijven dan die per 
nl|of de even bij elkaar en de oneven bij elkaar tegelijk en naast elkaar met 
nl|als "pole" de positie aan de binnenkant van de eerste bocht Naargelang het kampioenschap en 
nl|het circuit worden er of rondjes afgelegd De tijd hiervan geldt voor de startvolgorde voor 
nl|de tweede reeks die op dezelfde manier verloopt Dan volgt er nog een derde reeks 
nl|Voor de startvolgorde daarvan gelden eerste en tweede reeks samen Na de reeksen volgen de 
nl|finales De twee beste resultaten van de reeksen worden gebruikt om de startvolgorde te bepalen; 
nl|twee keer de finish bereiken tijdens de reeksen is dus nodig om een finale te 
nl|mogen rijden Er zijn finales D C B en A Een DFinale wordt enkel georganiseerd 
nl|indien er minstens piloten gekwalificeerd zijn voor de Finales De met de hoogste scores gaan 
nl|naar de DFinale De eerste en tweede gaan samen met de volgende gekwalificeerde piloten naar 
nl|de CFinale De winnaar daarvan krijgt de laatste startplaats bij de vijf volgende in de 
nl|B analoog voor de A De piloten starten niet meer naast elkaar maar verspringend de 
nl|eerste start op de pole de tweede op positie de derde achter positie de vierde 
nl|achter positie de vijfde twee plaatsen achter de tweede en de laatste twee plaatsen achter 
nl|positie van de reeksen het kan ook gebeuren dat de startrij van de reeksen als 
nl|laatste startrij van de finales dienstdoet en dat plaatsen tot en met van de finales 
nl|zich dus verder naar voor bevinden Uitzonderlijk wordt er voor nationale kampioenschappen onder andere in 
nl|Nederland en Ierland ook per acht gestart in de finales met piloten naast elkaar op 
nl|de eerste en de derde rij De afstand tussen de startstrepen van de verschillende rijen 
nl|bedraagt meter Naargelang het kampioenschap en het circuit rijden de piloten dan of zelfs ronden 
nl|De tijd speelt geen rol meer; het is de plaats die telt Voor de startvolgorde 
nl|worden niet de tijden bij elkaar opgeteld maar wel de daarmee verbonden plaatsen in de 
nl|bewuste reeks Wie in een reeks de snelste tijd neerzet krijgt voor die reeks één 
nl|punt de tweede twee en zo voort Wie in de twee eerste reeksen de snelste 
nl|tijd neerzet heeft dus sowieso de pole in de Afinale want niemand kan nog beter 
nl|doen dan twee punten en hoeft dus in principe de derde reeks niet meer te 
nl|rijden Wie uitvalt krijgt punten wie niet start en wie gediskwalificeerd wordt Deze punten kunnen 
nl|niet in rekening gebracht worden voor de startvolgorde van de finales vandaar dat twee tijden 
nl|noodzakelijk zijn Voor de uitslag van de wedstrijd telt enkel de volgorde waarin men de 
nl|finishlijn overschrijdt; de resultaten van de reeksen spelen geen rol meer Soms onder andere in 
nl|Duitsland en GrootBrittannië wordt er na de eigenlijke finales nog een zogenaamde superfinale gereden Deze 
nl|race verloopt zoals een gewone finale maar de starters kunnen uit de verschillende divisies komen 
nl|Degenen die aan de start mogen komen zijn immers de acht of zelfs tien start 
nl|in vier rijen piloten die tijdens de reeksen de snelste rondetijden hebben gedraaid Tijdens een 
nl|rallycrosswedstrijd worden signalen gegeven door middel van vlaggen De afstand tussen twee vlaggenposten is in 
nl|principe maximaal meter maximaal want de posten moeten zo liggen dat de officials van één 
nl|post die van de vorige en die van de volgende kunnen zien De startprocedure wordt 
nl|in principe in gang gezet met de roodwit geblokte uitzonderlijk de nationale of de groene 
nl|afvlaggen gebeurt met de zwartwit geblokte eventueel in combinatie met rood of gezwaaid geel waar 
nl|de piloten het circuit verlaten en terug de paddock induiken De start wordt gegeven door 
nl|middel van startlichten Als deze om één of andere reden niet gebruikt zouden kunnen worden 
nl|wordt de start ook met een vlag gegeven met name de nationale vlag van het 
nl|land waar het circuit gelegen is Deze vlag kan ook gebruikt worden om de individuele 
nl|rijders te laten starten bij de vrije training en de tijdtraining maar in dit geval 
nl|kan ook gewoon de groene vlag gebruikt worden Voor de start moet het circuit vrijgegeven 
nl|worden Dat gebeurt door aan elke vlaggenpost groen te vlaggen en eventueel aan de eerste 
nl|eerst rood en dan roodwit te zwaaien De gele vlag betekent dat er een voertuig 
nl|of voertuigonderdeel zich in de gevarenzone bevindt Enkel en stil betekent voertuig in zandbak enkel 
nl|gezwaaid betekent onderdeel op baan dubbel gezwaaid betekent voertuig op de baan Deze vlag wordt 
nl|gegeven aan de laatste post voor het obstakel bij de eerste passage Bij de tweede 
nl|steeds enkel en stilgehouden daarna gaat de vlag weg tenzij de situatie intussen veranderd is 
nl|Indien een voertuig zich tussen de finish en de eerste vlaggenpost bevindt mag er tijdens 
nl|de laatste ronde niet voor gevlagd worden omdat het zich dan buiten wedstrijd bevindt Onder 
nl|gele vlag moeten de piloten hun snelheid matigen en zich klaarhouden om eventueel uit te 
nl|wijken Inhalen is dan ook verboden Met de rode vlag legt men de wedstrijd stil 
nl|bijvoorbeeld omdat een gecrasht voertuig te gevaarlijk staat of omdat een valse start werd genomen 
nl|De zwarte vlag met nummerbord betekent dat de piloot met het getoonde startnummer voor die 
nl|reeks gediskwalificeerd wordt De diagonaal verdeelde zwartwitte vlag is een waarschuwing voor onsportief gedrag en 
nl|wordt ook getoond aan wie een valse start maakt Tweemaal deze vlag in dezelfde reeks 
nl|betekent zwart Zwart met een oranje bol wordt getoond aan piloten wiens voertuig bijvoorbeeld na 
nl|een aanrijding een zwaar defect vertoont dat voor de piloot of voor anderen een gevaar 
nl|betekent of zou kunnen betekenen Deze piloot moet dan zo snel mogelijk de paddock inrijden 
nl|De blauwe vlag wordt getoond aan een piloot als hem een snellere wagen volgt Stilgehouden 
nl|betekent dit gewoon voorbij laten gezwaaid voorbij laten of u wordt gestraft De witte vlag 
nl|wordt getoond aan de snellere piloot die achter deze tragere wagen rijdt Tot slot is 
nl|er nog de geelrood verticaal gestreepte vlag Deze wordt door de starter getoond voor de 
nl|wagens vertrekken en betekent dat er olie op de baan ligt De starter wijst ook 
nl|aan waar op de baan dit het geval is Ook als delen van de baan 
nl|tussen twee reeksen met water besproeid zijn bijvoorbeeld de onverharde delen om minder stof te 
nl|hebben wordt deze vlag bij de start getoond aan de eersten die na het besproeien 
nl|starten Soms wordt ze ook getoond aan de laatste post voor de bewuste plek en 
nl|zeker als de olie er pas tijdens de race terecht is gekomen bijvoorbeeld van een 
nl|gecrasht voertuig dat nog op eigen kracht naar een veiligere stopplaatsde paddock is gereden Er 
nl|zijn ook nog enkele nietofficiële vlaggen Dit zijn dan vlaggen die in andere autosportdisciplines wel 
nl|gebruikt worden en uitzonderlijk ook bij rallycross te zien zijn Een voorbeeld is de gele 
nl|vlag met een zwart kruis die gebruikt wordt om het ingaan van de laatste ronde 
nl|aan te geven heel zelden wordt hiervoor ook de witte vlag gebruikt Op de meeste 
nl|circuits wordt echter aan de finish het aantal nog te rijden ronden aangegeven verplicht voor 
nl|FIAwedstrijden waardoor deze vlag eigenlijk overbodig is en zelfs waar er geen teller staat wordt 
nl|deze vlag nog niet erg frequent gebruikt Indien een piloot een vlag negeert beslist de 
nl|wedstrijdleiding over zijn straf Dit kan een geldboete zijn maar meestal resulteert het negeren van 
nl|een andere vlag dan de zwarte in een zwarte vlag en het negeren van de 
nl|zwarte vlag in een uitsluiting van de race Voor de klassementen worden de punten toegekend 
nl|aan de hand van de einduitslag De puntenverdeling verloopt als volgt de winnaar krijgt punten 
nl|de tweede de derde en zo verder Voor sommige nationale kampioenschappen onder andere het Zweedse 
nl|worden daar ook nog eens extra punten van de tijdtraining bijgeteld voor de beste; voor 
nl|de tweede en voor de derde Bij de meeste kampioenschappen mogen de slechtste resultaten aantal 
nl|afhankelijk van het aantal wedstrijden meestal één of twee geschrapt worden Om een wedstrijd voor 
nl|een kampioenschap te kunnen laten meetellen moeten er minstens deelnemers zijn Soms wordt dit aangepast 
nl|voor nationale kampioenschappen Zo is bijvoorbeeld voor het Belgisch kampioenschap het minimumaantal starters niet maar 
nl|en voor het Oostenrijks kampioenschap is het zelfs maar Ook verloopt de puntentelling voor het 
nl|Oostenrijks kampioenschap als volgt Op februari werd op het Lydden Circuit van Wootton vaak ook 
nl|Lydden Hill genoemd tussen Dover en Canterbury in Engeland voor een televisieprogramma van de omroep 
nl|ITV de eerste rallycrosswedstrijd ooit gereden – onder uitgenodigde rallypiloten Al snel bleef dit circuit 
nl|in gebruik voor rallycross en werden er ook bij andere verharde circuits zoals Croft Circuit 
nl|en Cadwell Park onverharde stukken aangelegd voor rallycross De eerste rallycrosswedstrijd op het vasteland vond 
nl|op juni plaats op militair terrein in de hei nabij Venlo Op april werd het 
nl|eerste circuit speciaal voor rallycross gemaakt in gebruik genomen het Eurocircuit in Valkenswaard Het eerste 
nl|nog officieuze EK werd gereden in De wedstrijden vonden plaats in Oostenrijk Duitsland België Nederland 
nl|Engeland twee wedstrijden en Zweden race oorspronkelijk in Frankrijk gepland Het jaar daarop kwam Finland 
nl|erbij Ook in richtten de organiserende autoclubs de ERA European Rallycross Association op Sinds is 
nl|het EK van de ERA door de FIA Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile erkend en organiseert 
nl|deze een eigen EK Nu nog is het zo dat de FIA het eigenlijke EK 
nl|organiseert en dat een deel van die wedstrijden tevens de ERACup vormen Er zijn twee 
nl|landen die het EK al elke keer te gast gehad hebben België en Zweden Ook 
nl|zijn er drie circuits van de allereerste EKkalender waar nu nog steeds EKmanches doorgaan het 
nl|Duivelsbergcircuit B het Eurocircuit NL en de Estering D De eer van het grootste aantal 
nl|EKmanches gaat trouwens ook naar de Estering die er met uitzondering van en al elk 
nl|jaar bij was in zelfs twee keer en dus niet naar een circuit in België 
nl|of Zweden aangezien er in deze landen een tijd lang een beurtrol geweest is tussen 
nl|de circuits die het EK ontvingen gegevens tot en met EK In Nederland is er 
nl|één rallycrosscircuit met name het Eurocircuit in Valkenswaard Dat is overigens het eerste circuit ter 
nl|wereld dat specifiek voor rallycross werd aangelegd ter vervanging van een nietpermanent circuit nabij Venlo 
nl|Met het circuit kunnen verschillende namen verbonden worden maar eentje die zeker vermeld moet worden 
nl|is de Noor Martin Schanche die er maar liefst keer de EKwedstrijd won en naar 
nl|wie sinds enkele jaren het pleintje tussen het secretariaat en de cafetaria genoemd is Martin 
nl|Schanche Plein Vroeger waren er ook circuits in Axel Goes en RillandBath maar deze circuits 
nl|zijn intussen gesloten of omgebouwd voor andere disciplines Wat Nederlandse piloten betreft zijn naast Jan 
nl|de Rooy en Piet Dam vooral Cees Teurlings Ko Kasse MarcJan Vlassak en Ron Snoeck 
nl|en te noemen die diverse Europese titels haalden In België waren er ooit drie circuits 
nl|het Mandescircuit in Ingelmunster gesloten het Glossocircuit in Arendonk en het Duivelsbergcircuit in Opgrimbie bij 
nl|Maasmechelen al sinds juni in gebruik maar toen nog volledig onverhard; pas in kwamen de 
nl|verharde stukken er Tegenwoordig mag enkel het laatste nog voor internationale wedstrijden gebruikt worden; voor 
nl|regionale wedstrijden komt ook Arendonk nog in aanmerking Er zijn wel plannen voor de aanleg 
nl|van een nieuw circuit in Lommel met de steun van piloot Ludo Helven en aan 
nl|het circuit van Francorchamps deze plannen zijn opnieuw in de koelkast beland Ook in het 
nl|Waalse Mettet is er groot interesse voor een nieuw rallycrosscircuit Op november vond er een 
nl|wedstrijd plaats op het Circuit Jules Tacheny dat deels van de openbare weg gebruikmaakt en 
nl|daar zal er in de komende jaaren misschien een permanent rallycrosscircuit met onverharde passages aangelegd 
nl|worden Er zijn drie Belgen die een Europese titel in de wacht sleepten Tony Kuypers 
nl|in de cup een divisie die niet meer bestaat voor het EK; in Ronny Scheveneels 
nl|in divisie en Michaël De Keersmaecker in divisie en de RX Cup Ook de eerste 
nl|eindzege in deze RX Cup ging naar een Belg met name Jos Sterkens De rallycrosspiloot 
nl|bij uitstek in België was echter de tienvoudige rallycross kampioen de onderwijzer François Monten uit 
nl|Mol Het Groothertogdom Luxemburg moet het zonder circuit stellen; er zijn dan ook geen rallycrosspiloten 
nl|uit Luxemburg bekend Rallycross is zeer populair in Scandinavië Dat verklaart dan ook dat de 
nl|twee grootmeesters van de Europese rallycross "His Kennyness" Kenneth Hansen recordhouder qua aantal Europese titels 
nl|hij behaalde zijn veertiende in en "Mister Rallycross" Martin Schanche met Europese titels tweede uit 
nl|Zweden respectievelijk Noorwegen komen En ook vele andere Scandinavische rallycrossers doen het goed bv Matti 
nl|Alamäki uit Finland die vijf EKtitels behaalde en zijn landgenoot Jussi Pinomäki met twee EKtitels 
nl|De eerste wedstrijd in Scandinavië vond in Zweden plaats op oktober op het motocrosscircuit van 
nl|Hedemora Winnaar was de nog steeds rijdende Zweed Per Eklund Ook in Frankrijk is rallycross 
nl|enorm populair Toch zijn er eerder weinig Fransen die het EK rijden onder andere omwille 
nl|van de andere divisieindeling maar zij die het doen bijvoorbeeld JeanLuc Pailler in divisie komen 
nl|gewoonlijk toch goed mee Op september vond de eerste wedstrijd plaats op het toen nog 
nl|volledig onverharde oude circuit van Lohéac bij Rennes In Lohéac is er trouwens nog altijd 
nl|een circuit al is het huidige sinds met jokerlap met jump die echter door de 
nl|FIA werd afgekeurd als onveilig en daarom in werd aangepast pas in in gebruik genomen 
nl|In Duitsland heeft rallycross een dipje meegemaakt maar het begint terug beter te gaan In 
nl|waren er nog slechts twee circuits in gebruik de Estering in Buxtehude waar in ook 
nl|de allereerste Duitse rallycrosswedstrijd plaatsvond en de Gründautalring in Gründau naast het autocrosscircuit "Am Matschenberg" 
nl|Op de Nürburgring wordt geen rallycross meer gereden en ook de Auering en het circuit 
nl|van Stadtallendorf zijn niet meer in gebruik De Flämingring die enkele keren op de kalender 
nl|stond is zelfs nooit voor een rallycrosswedstrijd gebruikt En ook de Gründautalring die hoe langer 
nl|hoe meer verharde stukken heeft gekregen en nu zelfs volledig verhard is is dus geen 
nl|echt rallycrosscircuit meer In maart is echter een nieuwe omloop in gebruik genomen op het 
nl|terrein van de Motorsport Arena Oschersleben dus niet aan het autocrosscircuit "An den sieben Bergen" 
nl|eveneens in Oschersleben Daarnaast wil men op de militaire luchthaven Borstel van Stendal ook een 
nl|nieuw circuit openen de eigenlijke opening was gepland voor de zomer van maar waarschijnlijk zal 
nl|het ten vroegste in het seizoen in gebruik genomen worden en het autocrosscircuit van Schlüchtern 
nl|zou in de toekomst ook enkele verharde stukken kunnen krijgen Doel is Duitsland terug op 
nl|de rallycrosswereldkaart te plaatsen het aantal piloten is er nu vrij laag voor zo'n groot 
nl|land en goede prestaties op Europees vlak zijn dan ook zeer zeldzaam In Oostenrijk zijn 
nl|er nog drie circuits het PS Racing Center in Greinbach dat ook voor de EKmanches 
nl|gebruikt wordt de Wachauring in Melk heette oorspronkelijk Leruring en is nu in de eerste 
nl|plaats testcentrum van de ÖAMTC en de op internationaal vlak niet echt populaire Nordring heette 
nl|in het begin Britaxring in Fuglau bij Horn Veel Europese toppers zijn er niet zoals 
nl|vroeger bv drievoudig EKwinnaar Franz Wurz de vader van rijder Alexander Wurz maar toch is 
nl|de rallycross er nog populairder dan in sommige andere landen waaronder Zwitserland Ook daar is 
nl|er ooit rallycross geweest maar het aantal wedstrijden is op de vingers van één hand 
nl|te tellen De eerste vond plaats in op het eerder kleine circuit van Lignières In 
nl|de OostEuropese landen moet rallycross het opnemen tegen autocross die daar veel populairder is In 
nl|sommige landen trekt de rallycross toch ook aan in anderen veel minder Toch zijn er 
nl|een aantal goede circuits zoals de EKcircuits in Słomczyn Polen en Česká Lípa Tsjechië Net 
nl|omdat rallycross het er tegen autocross moet opnemen zijn veel van de andere circuits vooral 
nl|in de Baltische staten er eigenlijk autocrosscircuits volledig onverhard behalve de start of circuits met 
nl|een rallycross en een autocrossvariant In Spanje ooit waren er EKmanches op het Circuito de 
nl|Sils bij Gerona en Italië kende EKmanches op de Rallypista Santo Spirito in GropelloCairoli bij 
nl|Pavia is er van rallycross amper nog sprake In Portugal daarentegen is rallycross nog wel 
nl|vrij populair circuits te Lousada Montalegre Sever do Vouga en Castelo Branco + aanleg van 
nl|een nieuw circuit in Baltar Op de Britse eilanden zijn de meeste rallycrosscircuits asfaltcircuits waar 
nl|stukken onverhard bij aangelegd zijn Mondello Park in Ierland en onder andere Lydden Croft en 
nl|Knockhill in GrootBrittannië Op Europees niveau zie je zeer weinig Britse en Ierse deelnemers onder 
nl|andere omwille van de andere regels voor de wagens gewicht etc en omdat er sinds 
nl|enkele jaren geen EKmanches meer georganiseerd worden aan de overkant van het Kanaal Wel vindt 
nl|op het circuit van Croft jaarlijks de Superprix plaats een wedstrijd die in de eerste 
nl|plaats gehouden wordt tussen de Europese en verschillende nationale kampioenen Zoals bij de meeste autosporten 
nl|is er ook bij rallycross een indeling in divisies Hier volgt de indeling zoals ze 
nl|tegenwoordig voor het door de FIA georganiseerde Europees kampioenschap geldt Voor de nationale kampioenschappen kan 
nl|ze aangepast worden maar meestal is ze hier wel op gebaseerd Supercars vierwielaangedreven toerismewagens met 
nl|een turbomotor van max startnummers Super toerismewagens met voorwielaandrijving startnummers Touringcars tweewielaangedreven productiewagens startnummers Vanaf 
nl|komt hier een 'Cup'klasse startnummers bij met wagens met achterwielaandrijving en opgevat op basis van 
nl|de technische reglementen van divisie Het is de bedoeling dat deze klasse binnen enkele jaren 
nl|de "uitstervende" divisie zal gaan vervangen Er zijn ook een aantal zogenaamde "supportraces" Welke voertuigen 
nl|daaraan deelnemen verschilt van wedstrijd tot wedstrijd Zo is er bij het Nederlands kampioenschap de 
nl|Formula RallyRacing rallycross gereden met autocrossbuggy's Ook zijn er wedstrijden voor jonge startende piloten die 
nl|nog geen licentie en soms zelfs nog geen rijbewijs hebben In België en Nederland mogen 
nl|zij hun eigen wedstrijden rijden met Ford RSTwagens in Frankrijk konden ze dat tot en 
nl|met met Citroën voordien Citroën Saxo's Daarnaast zijn er ook nog races met in Nederland

nl|een foto van hem om hem naar Istanboel te lokken ze moet Bond helpen de

nl|Bey die hem vertelt over Romanova Nadat Bond met Kerim Bey erin geslaagd is de 
nl|moordenaar Krillencu te doden treft hij 's avonds laat Tatiana volledig naakt in zijn bed

nl|de LEKTOR is aanvallen zodat zij de machine kunnen terugstelen Ze gaan dan samen met 
nl|Kerim Bey de Oriënt Express op om de machine terug te krijgen maar wat ze 
nl|niet weten is dat SPECTRE's belangrijkste Executioner Donald 'Red' Grant met hen meereist Als ze 
nl|een tijdje op de trein zitten beleven ze samen een rustige romantische tijd met elkaar 
nl|maar als Bond haar beveelt haar jurkje uit te trekken en haar normale kleren aan 
nl|te trekken om wat te gaan drinken met Kerim Bey blijkt het dat hij omgekomen 
nl|is Bond wil weten wie Tatiana de orders gegeven heeft maar Tatiana zwijgt echter voor 
nl|een hele tijd Bond ontmoet later in Zagreb Red Grant als de trein tijdelijk gestopt 
nl|is Hij dineert die avond met Grant waarbij Tatiana iets in haar drinken krijgt van 
nl|Grant wat ze echter niet doorheeft Ze valt die avond al snel in slaap dankzij 
nl|Grant Bond ontdekt die avond dat Grant voor SPECTRE werkt en dat hij de orders 
nl|van Rosa Klebb gekregen heeft Bond te doden en zo de LEKTOR in handen te 
nl|krijgen Hij was het echter ook die Kerim Bey heeft laten omkomen Bond komt er 
nl|in het gesprek achter dat Tatiana haar orders ook van Klebb kreeg Bond vermoordt Grant

nl|Terwijl Bond aan de telefoon zit wordt hij onder schot gehouden door Klebb Tatiana krijgt 
nl|de orders ervandoor te gaan met de LEKTOR zodat Klebb een einde kan maken aan

nl|Süper Lig was het drieënvijftigste seizoen van de Süper Lig De competitie had vanaf een 
nl|nieuwe sponsor en naamgever SporToto Süper Lig was de officiële naam die vrijwel uitsluitend in 
nl|de media werd gebruikt terwijl de fans gewoon van Süper Lig spraken Deze veelbesproken jaargang 
nl|begon op augustus en eindigde officieel op mei maar aan de groene tafel is dit 
nl|seizoen in nog steeds niet afgelopen Dat heeft alles te maken met een enorm matchfixingschandaal 
nl|rondom kampioen Fenerbahçe SK Na wedstrijden had herfstkampioen Trabzonspor een voorsprong van punten op Bursaspor 
nl|en op Fenerbahçe SK en leek met toppers als Burak Yılmaz en Umut Bulut in 
nl|de gelederen de titel voor het eerst sinds weer eens naar de boorden van Zwarte 
nl|Zee te halen Tijdens de terugronde begon Fenerbahçe SK echter aan een imposante en voor 
nl|onmogelijk gehouden inhaalrace de club won zestien wedstrijden en speelde er een gelijk Zowel Trabzonspor 
nl|als Fenerbahçe SK eindigde op punten maar het onderlinge resultaat in Trabzon in İstanbul gaf 
nl|de doorslag Fenerbahçe SK was voor de achttiende maal in de historie kampioen De vreugde 
nl|over deze achttiende titel zou echter van korte duur zijn op juli werd Feners voorzitter 
nl|Aziz Yıldırım een zakenman met een dubieuze reputatie gearresteerd op verdenking van omkoping bij wedstrijden 
nl|het uitdelen van aanmoedigingspremies en het bezit van meerdere ongedocumenteerde vuurwapens In verband met het 
nl|omkopingsschandaal werden in totaal personen aangehouden In de uiteindelijke aanklacht tegen Aziz Yıldırım was sprake 
nl|van negentien wedstrijden waarin hij onder meer aanmoedigingspremies aan in totaal veertien clubs zou hebben 
nl|Hangende het onderzoek sloot de UEFA Fenerbahçe SK één dag voor de loting van de 
nl|groepswedstrijden in de Champions League gedurende één seizoen uit van Europees voetbal; Trabzonspor dat zich 
nl|al geplaatst had voor de groepswedstrijden van de Europa League nam de opengevallen plek in 
nl|Op juli kwam Aziz Yıldırım voorwaardelijk vrij en ging in hoger beroep Fenerbahçe SK mocht 
nl|in wel meedoen aan de voorronden van de Champions League en later het hoofdtoernooi van 
nl|de Europa League maar omdat de Türkiye Futbol Federasyonu niet echt haast maakte met het 
nl|onderzoek naar het matchfixingschandaal schorste de UEFA Fenerbahçe SK in opnieuw nu voor de duur 
nl|van twee seizoenen De Sarı Kanaryalar Gele Kanaries gingen nog wel in hoger beroep bij 
nl|het Court of Arbitration for Sport kortweg CAS maar dat mocht niet baten Voor de 
nl|UEFA stond Yıldırıms schuld vast en de Europese voetbalbond drong nu aan op een spoedige 
nl|beslissing van de Turkse bond; er was zelfs sprake van het verplicht inleveren van de 
nl|titel van en van verplichte degradatie naar de Lig Sommige websites lopen alvast vooruit op 
nl|de zaken en kennen het kampioenschap van alvast toe aan Trabzonspor maar zover is het 
nl|nog niet tot er een definitief oordeel is geveld gaat dit overzicht ervan uit dat 
nl|Fenerbahçe SK de kampioen van is Topscorer van de liga werd Alex de Souza met 
nl|doelpunten waarvan hij negen maal vanaf elf meter mocht aanleggen De twee andere leden van 
nl|de Üç Büyükler Grote Drie ging het in het seizoen beduidend minder goed Beşiktaş JK 
nl|werd in de competitie ondanks enkele topaankopen en de aanwezigheid van trainer Bernd Schuster slechts 
nl|vijfde maar won wel de bekerfinale door de strafschoppen tegen İstanbul BB beter te nemen 
nl|Ook aan deze bekercampagne hing echter een zweem van omkoping zodat de Kara kartallar Zwarte 
nl|Adelaars de gewonnen beker tijdelijk teruggaven aan de Türkiye Futbol Federasyonu; of de club deze 
nl|beker terugkrijgt is anno nog steeds niet duidelijk; wel werd Beşiktaş JK dat jaar voor 
nl|één seizoen uitgesloten van Europees voetbal Ook Galatasaray SK was het seizoen met trainer Frank 
nl|Rijkaard vol hoge verwachtingen begonnen maar op oktober werd deze vervangen door Gheorghe Hagi Ook 
nl|hij kon in zijn derde periode bij de club echter niet overtuigen en op maart 
nl|moest hij op zijn beurt plaats maken voor Bülent Ünder Intussen had de club halverwege 
nl|het seizoen wel het oude Ali Sami Yenstadion verlaten en op januari de gloednieuwe Türk 
nl|Telekom Arena die plaats bood aan toeschouwers betrokken Die zagen dat de Aslanlar Leeuwen dat 
nl|jaar niet verder kwamen dan een beschamende achtste plaats Op juli nam Antalyaspor de naam 
nl|van de sponsor op in de clubnaam en speelde vanaf die datum onder de naam 
nl|Medical Park Antalyaspor Geheel nieuw in de Süper Lig dit jaar was Bucaspor een club 
nl|uit de İzmirse wijk Buca; de club hield het niet langer dan één jaar vol 
nl|en neemt op de Eeuwige ranglijst van de Süper Lig een bescheiden plaats in Terug 
nl|van weggeweest waren Lardemir DÇ Karabükspor en Konyaspor; laatstgenoemde club verdween ook nu weer na 
nl|één seizoen De derde degradant was Kasımpaşa SK Het gat tussen de nummer en de 
nl|drie degradanten was al snel geslagen dus de degradatiestrijd was dit jaar niet zo spannend

nl|slaperig suf of afwezig worden en telkens de neiging krijgen in te dutten Dit kan 
nl|gepaard gaan met misselijkheid en hevig braken diarree of een algemeen gevoel van onwelzijn Meestal 
nl|merkt men dat sprake is van alcoholvergiftiging doordat het slachtoffer niet meer reageert op prikkels 
nl|zoals aanspreken aanroepen aangrijpen of op de wang tikken Andere symptomen zijn ademstilstand coma en 
nl|eventueel hartstilstand Een alcoholvergiftiging kan dus dodelijk aflopen en er komen dan ook regelmatig incidenten 
nl|voor waarbij dit gebeurt Wanneer men alcoholvergiftiging constateert of vermoedt zal men snel moeten handelen 
nl|Indien het slachtoffer nog bij kennis is zal men moeten proberen hem te laten braken 
nl|en bij kennis te houden voor hij het bewustzijn verliest Het is verder goed het 
nl|slachtoffer gerust te stellen naar een koele of rustige ruimte te brengen en hem of 
nl|haar geen verwijten te maken Sowieso moet iemand die dronken is of aan alcoholvergiftiging lijdt 
nl|niet alleen worden gelaten Bij bewusteloosheid moet zo snel mogelijk een ambulance komen om het 
nl|slachtoffer naar het ziekenhuis te vervoeren om zijn maag leeg te pompen Het is verstandig 
nl|hem of haar in een stabiele zijligging te leggen met het oog op braken en 
nl|vrijhouden van de luchtwegen Indien nodig en beschikbaar kan men het slachtoffer bedekken met een 
nl|deken Mocht het slachtoffer niet meer ademen dan kan men het slachtoffer beademen Indien men 
nl|niet weet hoe men moet beademen kan men het beste de komst van professionele hulpverlening 
nl|afwachten Meestal komt het niet zo ver omdat iemand die zich zwaar bedrinkt op een 
nl|gegeven moment misselijk wordt en moet overgeven waardoor hij wel moet ophouden met drinken Wanneer 
nl|iemand echter in een hoog tempo sterke drank of likeur drinkt zal de alcohol echter 
nl|hiervoor te snel worden opgenomen Andere factoren die meespelen zijn de leeftijd en het geslacht

nl|arbeidskrachtverhuizingen en georganiseerde migraties in tegengestelde richtingen om etnisch gezuiverde gebieden te herbevolken In de 
nl|meeste gevallen bestond de bestemming uit onderbevolkte en afgelegen gebieden De koelakken waren het bevolkingsdeel 
nl|dat het meest gedeporteerd is Hervestiging van personen die officieel als koelak bestempeld werden ging 
nl|door tot begin in verschillende golven Sommige etnische deportaties bijvoorbeeld die van de Polen na 
nl|uit geannexeerde gebieden in het huidige WitRusland en WestOekraïne toentertijd OostPolen werden ook gerechtvaardigd met

nl|het nog tot moest duren voor de Krimtataren Mescheten en WolgaDuitsers werd toegestaan om en 
nl|masse terug te keren naar hun thuisland De deportaties hadden een diepgaande invloed op de

nl|Merce Cunningham Centralia april – New York juli was een Amerikaanse choreograaf die van grote 
nl|invloed was op de moderne dans van de eeuw Cunningham werd geboren als zoon van 
nl|een advocaat Hij had twee broers die zijn vader opvolgde in het rechten leven Als 
nl|leerde hij tapdansen Van tot studeerde hij dans en theater aan de Cornish School in 
nl|Seattle Vanaf tot danste hij solo in het dansgezelschap van Martha Graham Hij ontwierp zijn 
nl|eerste choreografie in in New York met John Cage als pianist In zag zijn Merce 
nl|Cunningham Dance Company het levenslicht Tot op heden voerde het gezelschap een choreografieën op Door 
nl|zijn werk als choreograaf en danser stond Cunningham meer dan jaar op het voorplan in 
nl|deze discipline Hij had een sterke invloed op andere kunstuitingen en kunstenaars zoals de musici 
nl|John Cage en David Tudor de beeldende kunstenaars Robert Rauschenberg en Bruce Nauman designer Romeo 
nl|Gigli en architect Benedetta Tagliabue Als docent en hoofd van de Merce Cunningham Dance Company 
nl|vernieuwde hij in de jaren vijftig alle gangbare codes van het toenmalige beschrijvende ballet Als 
nl|choreograaf verliet hij de verhaallijn en de logische opbouw Hij liet zijn dansers geen verhaal 
nl|vertellen op muziek met een aangepast decor maar liet de choreografie het verhaal vertellen Daarbij 
nl|introduceerde hij het toeval in de dans met aleatorische muziek van Cage Terwijl hij aan 
nl|het Black Mountain College was verbonden ontstond in de ondertussen legendarische happening met Cage en 
nl|Rauschenberg Ook Jasper Johns Charles Atlas en William Anastani leverden hun creatieve bijdrage Langzamerhand kregen 
nl|Cunninghams opvattingen meer invloed in de danswereld Elke beweging kon gaandeweg als dans aanzien worden 
nl|in de postmoderne optiek Kenmerkend voor Cunninghams choreografie was een beweginsstijl vol plotse wendingen minieme 
nl|sprongetjes rompdraaiingen en langzame evenwichtsverplaatsingen gevat in verrassende ruimtelijke patronen Daarbij liet de choreograaf zich 
nl|inspireren door het gewriemel van mensen in de New Yorkse straten Ook de observatie van 
nl|de natuur en de beweging van vogels bracht inspiratie zoals bij creaties als Winterbranch Beach 
nl|Birds en Ocean In de jaren negentig van de twintigste eeuw betrok Cunningham de pc 
nl|als compositorisch hulpmiddel bij zijn creaties als Biped In gaf hij met de creatie van 
nl|EyeSpace de toeschouwers de kans zelf muziek te kiezen via de iPod In april vierde 
nl|de choreograaf zijn negentigste verjaardag met de première van een nieuw werk Nearly Ninety aan 
nl|de Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in samenwerking met de musici John Paul 
nl|Jones exbassist van Led Zeppelin Sonic Youth en Takehisa Kosugi De choreograaf ontving vele hoge 
nl|onderscheidingen zoals de National Medal of Arts en de MacArthur Fellowship Hij werd ook gehuldigd 
nl|met de Japanse Praemium Imperiale de Britse Laurence Olivier Award en was Officier in het 
nl|Franse Legioen van Eer Cunninghams kunstzinnige visie op dans en beweging was het onderwerp van 
nl|vele publicaties films en tentoonstellingen Zijn choreografieën werden uitgevoerd door belangrijke balletgroepen zoals het Ballet 
nl|van de Parijse Opera het New York City Ballet het American Ballet Theatre het White 
nl|Oak Dance Project en de Londense Rambert Dance Company De choreograaf riep de The Merce 
nl|Cunningham Trust in het leven om zijn totale oeuvre te bewaren na zijn dood Daarbij 
nl|stelde hij dat zijn dansgezelschap nog twee jaar zou optreden en vervolgens zichzelf zou ontbinden 
nl|Daarna zouden de dansers een financiële vergoeding krijgen van deze trust In kondigde Cunningham de 
nl|Cunningham Dance Foundation aan met een voorstel tot voortzetting van het werk van Cunningham teneinde 
nl|zijn artistieke erfenis veilig te stellen Deze stichting beheert ook de rechten op de producties 
nl|Zij zal ook de creaties in detail laten vastleggen zodat deze nadien precies door anderen 
nl|kunnen uitgevoerd worden De stichting zal ook Cunninghams kunstverzameling bestaande uit decors van Jasper Johns 
nl|en Robert Rauschenberg beheren Vele dansers die dansten in zijn gezelschap vormden later hun eigen 
nl|dansgroepen zoals Paul Taylor Trisha Brown Lucinda Childs Karole Armitage Foofwa d’Immobilité en Jonah Bokaer 
nl|Ook Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker maakte tijdens haar dansopleiding te New York kennis met Cunninghams

nl|Het is niet geweten wanneer de firtel exact is ontstaan Uit inlichtingen die destijds door 
nl|erenotaris PieterHendrik Martens werden verstrekt weten we dat er vóór al fietelliedjes werden geschreven voor 
nl|de stoet Het fietellied werd toen gewoonlijk geschreven door de verdienstelijke rederrijkersdichter uit Wakken PeterJoost 
nl|de Borchgraeve De stoet had geen religieuze oorsprong Vanaf de jaren werd er geen stoet 
nl|meer georganiseerd door de felle armoede die heerste in Zulte Het terugkeren van de stoet 
nl|gebeurde maar in In werd de fietelstoet 'geherintroduceerd' door Zultenaars Clemens Verplaetse Jan Standaert en 
nl|Leo Lefever Deze drie heren gingen op de dinsdag na de traditionele tweedaagse kermis verkleed 
nl|een aantal herbergen bezoeken Dit deden ze al zingend en springend doorheen het dorp Aangemoedigd 
nl|door de bijval gingen ze zich vertonen op het kasteel van Zulte waar ze van 
nl|baron Limnander een kan bier en een dubbele frank drinkgeld kregen Hoewel er dus zeker 
nl|voorlopers geweest zijn is het die editie die vandaag de dag beschouwd wordt als de 
nl|definitieve start van de Firteltraditie Het volgende jaar werd besloten meer te doen en zo 
nl|gebeurde het ook de fietel was herboren Onder impuls van enkele nieuwe fietelmannen werd in 
nl|een 'stoet met talrijke verbeteringen' voorgesteld De heropleving was een feit en in waren er 
nl|deelnemende fietelwagens In die periode werd ook beslist de stoet op dinsdagnamiddag te laten doorgaan 
nl|Vanaf werd er ook vuurwerk afgeschoten In het jaar ging de laatste vooroorlogse fietel door 
nl|Na de eerste wereldoorlog dook de Firtelstoet opnieuw op Vanaf nu werd het ook Firtel 
nl|genoemd om welke reden dan ook De stoet ging nu definitief uit op dinsdagnamiddag en 
nl|'s avonds volgde de fakkeltocht Onder impuls van Nestor en Gaston Martens ging de stoet 
nl|enkele succesvolle jaren tegemoet tussen beide oorlogen In ging de firtel voor de laatste keer 
nl|door voor de tweede wereldoorlog De stoet trok zich in traag terug op gang Het 
nl|was een schuchtere start met slechts praalwagens Vanaf zat er nieuw leven in want toen 
nl|melden zich liefst groepen aan In de jaren zat de firtel in een bloeiende periode 
nl|In schreef De Gentenaar dat de jongste uitgave schitterend geslaagd is Een zee van volk 
nl|een cristalisatie van suggestieve uitbeeldingen Het verloop getuigde van organisatiegeest en mocht terecht bogen op 
nl|de algemene bewondering van duizenden toeschouwers In werd de honderdste verjaardag van de firtel gevierd 
nl|Toen werd er speciaal eeen firtelbok gemaakt en is sindsdien het symbool van de stoet 
nl|Ook brouwde AngloBelge speciaal voor de gelegenheid een 'firtelbok'biertje De viering van deze firtel werd 
nl|ingezet op zaterdagavond met het proces en de verbranding van de oude reuzen en de 
nl|inhuldiging en huwelijk van de nieuwe De dag erop zondag oktober ging de stoet voor 
nl|het eerst in zijn geschiedenis door op een zondag De belangstelling was enorm want duizenden 
nl|toeschouwers waren van overal naar Zulte afgezakt De pers was eveneens talrijk aanwezig en op 
nl|diezelfde avond was er een filmverslag op de Vlaamse Televisie praalwagens namen deel aan de 
nl|editie een nieuw record dat zelfs tot op de dag van vandaag niet werd gebroken 
nl|Op dinsdagavond werd de feesteditie afgesloten met de traditionele fakkeltocht In en probeerden ze de 
nl|stoet terug op een dinsdag te laten doorgaan maar vanaf werd definitief gekozen voor de 
nl|eerste zondag van oktober Deze wisseling van datum betekende echter ook het stille einde van 
nl|de tradionele fakkeltocht die op dinsdagavond doorging Het aantal deelnemers slonk jaar na jaar en 
nl|in ging de laatste fakkeltocht uit Na nog enkele succesvolle firteledities kende de stoet een 
nl|nieuw dieptepunt in met slechts vier deelnemende praalwagens De stoet werd stilaan uitgebreid met showkorpsen 
nl|en dansgroepen uit Zulte en omstreken In de jaren werd werk gemaakt van een heropleving 
nl|van de firtel Talrijke nieuwe initiatieven werden er in en rond de stoet georganiseerd sommige 
nl|succesvol andere een kort leven beschoren De firtelstoet zelf kende van tot een heropleving met 
nl|meer dan deelnemende praalwagens De opleving was echter weer van korte duur want in titelde 
nl|het Nieuwsblad firtel in krisis De firtel krabbelde met enkele kleine heroplevingen door tot het 
nl|jaar wat tot nu toe het dieptepunt is van alle firtels met slechts drie praalwagens 
nl|Vanaf is het aantal deelnemers weer positief toegenomen met meer dan tien firtelwagens in het 
nl|jaar en Ook de magische verjaardag in werd er één om nooit te vergeten De 
nl|week voor de firtel werd een standbeeld van twee dansende firtelbokken onthuld op het kerkplein 
nl|van Zulte Dit beeld werd geschonken door de Vriendenkring van Zulte en werd ontworpen door

nl|op touw gezet om de jaargang te vieren Het aantal wagens blijft stabiel op een 
nl|en de publiciteitskaravaan die sinds een aantal jaren de stoet vooraf gaat trekt ieder jaar 
nl|meer en meer deelnemers De firtelstoet bestaat uit tientallen deelnemers en groepen De stoet begint 
nl|met een autopubliciteitskaravaan deze bestaat uit wagens en vrachtwagens van de lokale handelaars en bedrijven 
nl|die de firtelstoet steunen Tijdens het traject gooien de deelnemers verschillende snoep en gadgets naar

nl|de verschillende Deltaraketten is er nog een configuratie in gebruik de Delta IV Heavy De 
nl|eerste Deltaraket was een aangepaste versie van de Thor de eerste ballistische raket van de 
nl|United States Air Force De Thor zelf was midden jaren ontworpen met als doel Moskou 
nl|te kunnen bereiken vanaf een lanceerplatform in het Verenigd Koninkrijk Voor de Delta werd de 
nl|Thor voorzien van een tweede trap Hiervoor werd geëxperimenteerd met verschillende modellen rakettrappen waarvan het 
nl|vierde ontwerp geschikt bleek De naam Delta is dan ook afgeleid van de Griekse letter 
nl|Delta de vierde letter in het alfabet De volledige naam van de raket was officieel 
nl|‘Thor Delta’ maar dit werd al snel afgekort tot simpelweg ‘Delta’ Van tot bleef de 
nl|Thor de belangrijkste basis voor de eerste trap van de Deltaraketten NASA wilde de Deltaraketten 
nl|gebruiken als tijdelijke oplossing voor het lanceren van communicatie meteorologische en onderzoekssatellieten alsmede maanverkenners gedurende 
nl|en Daarna zou de Delta door een nieuw type raket moeten worden vervangen De Delta 
nl|was verder meer gericht op betrouwbaarheid dan op prestatievermogen onder andere door onderdelen die bij 
nl|de Thor vaak problemen gaven te vervangen In april kreeg Douglas Aircraft Company een contract 
nl|om de Deltaraketten te bouwen voor NASA Het ontwerp was als volgt Deze voertuigen konden 
nl|in totaal kilo aan vracht meenemen naar een baan om de aarde op tot kilometer 
nl|hoogte De totale kosten voor de ontwikkeling van de eerste Deltaraketten bedroeg miljoen dollar miljoen 
nl|meer dan begroot Van de lanceringen mislukte er één In besloot NASA langer door te 
nl|gaan met de Delta en liet nog raketten bouwen Vanaf de introductie van de DeltaD 
nl|in werden voor extra kracht vaste brandstofmotoren aan de zijkant van Delta’s toegevoegd Deze motoren 
nl|uit de Castorserie werden door Thiokol nu onderdeel van Northrop Grumman vervaardigd Vanaf de Delta 
nl|en werden de Castors vervangen door Graphite Epoxymotoren GEM van Alliant Techsystems ook onderdeel van 
nl|Northrop Grumman Het belangrijkste verschil tussen Castors en GEM’s is dat de Castors van aluminium 
nl|werden gemaakt terwijl GEM’s van het veel lichtere grafietepoxy zijn gemaakt Er zijn vier grote 
nl|klassen Deltaraketten te onderscheiden Binnen deze klassen bestaan tal van verschillende modellen en ontwerpen Deze 
nl|werden oorspronkelijk genummerd met letters van het alfabet Delta A Delta B enz In introduceerde 
nl|McDonnell Douglas een nieuwe nummeringsysteem met getallen van elk vier cijfers Dit systeem was meer 
nl|toepasbaar om de vele modificaties die voortdurend werden aangebracht bij te houden De Deltaraketten werden 
nl|per revisie steeds krachtiger Anders dan bij de Delta's met lettercodering was de diameter van 
nl|zowel eerste als tweede trap gelijk bij deze serie Delta's gelijk De rechte acht voet 
nl|in diameter zijnde Delta kreeg daardoor de bijnaam "straight eight" rechte acht Begin jaren tachtig 
nl|was besloten de Delta uit te faseren alle lanceringen moesten in de toekomst door de 
nl|Spaceshuttle worden uitgevoerd Ook mislukten rond die tijd een aantal Deltalanceringen Na het Spaceshuttle ongeluk 
nl|met de Challenger wilde men echter weer “Expendable Launch Vehicles” ELV’s voor satellietlanceringen Men wilde 
nl|daarvoor geen levens riskeren Daarom moest er een betrouwbare gemoderniseerde Deltaraket komen Dit werd de 
nl|Delta II In de tussentijd werden resterende voorraden Delta onderdelen van de oude Delta’s zoveel 
nl|mogelijk opgebruikt Ook combineerde men oude Deltaonderdelen met nieuwe Delta IIonderdelen waardoor de tijdelijke Delta 
nl|en ontstonden In werd met de introductie van de Delta II het systeem van de 
nl|Romeinse cijfers geïntroduceerd De Delta II behield echter ook de vier cijferige codering om de 
nl|configuratie aan te geven Zo was de eerste Delta II de serie" en is de 
nl|serie een geüpgrade krachtiger Delta II Sinds werd de Delta II niet meer gebouwd maar 
nl|er waren nog een vijf complete raketten op voorraad Op september werd voor de laatste 
nl|keer een Delta II gelanceerd In totaal werden er gelanceerd waarvan succesvol De enige overgebleven 
nl|Delta II zal in het bezoekerscentrum van het Kennedy Space Center worden geëxposeerd De Delta 
nl|II is houder van het record van succesvolle lanceringen op rij De Delta III gebruikte 
nl|een eerste trap die grotendeels overeenkwam met die van de Delta de diameter van de 
nl|brandstoftanks was echter iets groter De sideboosters waren grotere staat voor de inch diameter in 
nl|plaats van de van de Delta Voor de Delta III werd een nieuwe cryogene upperstage 
nl|met een als hoofdmotor ontworpen De Delta III werd eind jaren slechts drie maal gelanceerd 
nl|waarvan alleen de laatste deels succesvol was De Delta III kan worden gezien als een 
nl|mislukt project maar was tegelijkertijd succesvol waar het ging om het ontwikkelen van nieuwe technieken 
nl|Na annulering vond de zijn weg op een nieuwe zwaardere Delta IIconfiguratie de Delta IIheavy 
nl|Het ontwerp van de tweede trap werd op de Delta IV hergebruikt Daarna werd met 
nl|steun van de Amerikaanse Luchtmacht het EELV Delta IV ontwikkeld De Delta IV gebruikte dezelfde 
nl|upperstage als de Delta III Voor de eerste trap werd de de eerste grote Amerikaanse 
nl|raketmotor sinds de ontworpen Net als de Delta II heeft de Delta IV enkele tussentijdse 
nl|upgrades gehad en zijn in meerdere configuraties inzetbaar De Delta IVHeavyconfiguratie was sinds de krachtigste 
nl|actieve draagraket van de maar verloor begin die titel toen de Falcon Heavy voor het 
nl|eerst vloog De Delta IV wordt vrijwel alleen voor militaire lanceringen gebruikt Uitzondering waren twee 
nl|lanceringen van een Delta IVHeavy in opdracht van NASA omdat daarvoor geen ander type raket 
nl|met vergelijkbare capaciteiten beschikbaar was De bouw van raket was te duur om mee te 
nl|doen op de commerciële markt De laatste lancering zal in plaatsvinden Een aangepaste uitvoering van 
nl|de tweede trap zal ook voor enkele vluchten van het Space Launch System worden gebruikt 
nl|Veel Delta raketten hadden de typisch blauwe kleur die later Delta Blue ging heten In 
nl|eerste instantie werden Delta’s wit geschilderd Om massa te besparen werd begin jaren besloten de 
nl|witte verflaag niet langer aan te brengen waardoor de typisch blauwe grondverf zichtbaar werd Deze 
nl|kleur ging symbool staan voor de Delta Op een Delta II zat ongeveer liter gallon 
nl|AksoNobel “Blue Fluid Resistant Primer” Ook grote delen van de lanceerinstalaties waren met deze kleur 
nl|beschilderd Bij de Delta IV was het niet mogelijk om diezelfde kleur te gebruiken Die 
nl|raket heeft namelijk een laag roestbruin isolatieschuim om de brandstoftanks om te voorkomen dat de 
nl|cryogene brandstoffen al te veel kunnen opwarmen Met de aankondiging van de Vulcan werd ook 
nl|de definitieve uitfasering van de Delta II in en de Delta IV Medium aangekondigd ULA 
nl|zal nog wel zolang als dat in nodig werd geacht de Delta IV Heavy blijven 
nl|leveren De USAF verwachtte in voldoende alternatieve zeer zware EELV’s te hebben en dan dus 
nl|de zeer dure Delta IV Heavy niet meer nodig te hebben De laatste Delta II 
nl|vlucht werd in uitgevoerd en de laatste Delta IV Medium vlucht werd naar verschoven De

nl|gemeente Helden wilde ook een duitje in het zakje doen en niets leek een fusie 
nl|van de twee handbalverenigingen in de weg te staan Plotseling moesten alle plannen de koelkast 
nl|in en uiteindelijk ontaardde de zo vreedzaam begonnen onderhandelingen zelfs in een ordinaire burenruzie "We 
nl|gaan hier niet uit de doeken doen wat er zich allemaal afspeelde Geen fusie handbalvereniging

nl|van Internationale Justitie Loder studeerde rechten aan het Athenaeum Illustre de voorloper van de Universiteit 
nl|van Amsterdam Hij promoveerde in te Leiden op de leer van de volkssoevereiniteit waarbij hij 
nl|de volkssoevereiniteit als grondslag van de staat verwierp Zijn opvattingen waren conservatiefliberaal hetgeen onder meer 
nl|bleek doordat hij zich in uitliet tegen het algemeen kiesrecht en hij hing de Historische 
nl|School van Friedrich Carl von Savigny aan Codificaties moesten volgens deze School op de eerste 
nl|plaats "wetenschappelijk" zijn waarbij ze maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen eerder volgden dan beïnvloedden Wetenschappelijke wetten konden uitsluitend

nl|Ester Boserup geboren Børgesen Kopenhagen mei Ascona september was een Deens econoom en demograaf die 
nl|zich specialiseerde in economische en agrarische ontwikkeling Ze werkte onder meer voor de Verenigde Naties 
nl|en andere internationale organisaties Boserup is bekend door haar theorie van agrarische intensivering die ingaat 
nl|tegen de malthusiaanse catastrofe De theorie van Boserup stelt dat bevolkingsdruk innovatie in de hand 
nl|werkt in de landbouw waarmee de voedselproductie verhoogd wordt om de bevolkingsgroei te faciliteren Daarmee 
nl|ging zij in tegen Thomas Malthus die juist stelde dat de bevolkingsgroei uiteindelijk beperkt wordt 
nl|door de grenzen van de landbouwproductie Ester Børgesen was de enige dochter van een ingenieur 
nl|die de zoon was van een textielondernemer die overleed aan diabetes mellitus toen zij twee 
nl|jaar oud was Kort daarna maakte een crisis in de textielindustrie dat de familie hun 
nl|kapitaal verloor zodat Boserup in armoede opgroeide Haar moeder moedigde haar aan te studeren en 
nl|in toen zij negentien was begon zij aan de Universiteit van Kopenhagen Toen zij eenentwintig 
nl|was trouwde zij Mogens Boserup Tijdens haar studie was zij enige tijd aangesloten bij de 
nl|Deense Clartébeweging tot deze over werd genomen door de Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti In studeerde zij 
nl|af als candpolit in theoretische economie met daarnaast sociologie en landbouwbeleid De crisis van de 
nl|jaren was van grote invloed op haar keuze voor meerdere vakgebieden Voor haar afstuderen richtte 
nl|zij zich op de Amerikaanse institutionele economie en de crisistheorie van Karl Marx In kwam 
nl|The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money van John Maynard Keynes uit en vergeleek 
nl|Boserup de geneigdheid om te consumeren van Keynes met de marxistische onderconsumptietheorie Na haar afstuderen 
nl|begon zij voor de Deense overheid te werken op de afdeling die in was opgezet 
nl|toen de Deense exportprijzen instorten en de import aan banden werd gelegd Zij richtte haar 
nl|aandacht op de verschillen tussen grote en kleine landen bij vrijhandel en protectionisme en staatsinterventie 
nl|Zo bekritiseerde zij de steun die de Deense overheid gaf aan de productie van boter 
nl|en varkensvlees waarvan zij vreesde dat dit op de langere termijn eerder het effect van 
nl|een slaappil zou hebben dan van een versterkend medicijn In deze periode kreeg zij drie 
nl|kinderen dochter Birte in en zonen Anders in en Ivan in In begon zij te 
nl|werken voor de Europese economische commissie van de Verenigde Naties ECE en verhuisde met haar 
nl|man naar Genève Ook hier lag haar nadruk op handel en landbouw en schreef zij 
nl|onder meer over het verwoestende effect van voedselhulp op de landbouw in Afrika Zij onderzocht 
nl|ook of er een verband was tussen de lage economische groei van Frankrijk en de 
nl|geringe bevolkingsgroei In begonnen zij en Mogens te werken met Gunnar Myrdal ook van de 
nl|ECE Samen onderzochten zij voor het Twentieth Century Fund de economische ontwikkeling van India Tijdens 
nl|haar reizen door India kwam zij tot de conclusie dat de westerse ideeën over landbouwproductie 
nl|meerarbeid bevolkingsdichtheid en migratie niet of nauwelijks opgingen voor India Boserup werd steeds sceptischer over 
nl|de bestaande ontwikkelingstheorieën wat niet overeenkwam met de ideeën van Myrdal Als malthusiaan ging Myrdal 
nl|er vanuit dat de bevolkingsgroei in Azië de economische groei zou afremmen Na de voltooiing 
nl|in van het overeengekomen onderzoek ging Boserup dan ook geen verder onderzoek meer met hem 
nl|aan en keerde zij met haar man terug naar Denemarken Myrdal publiceerde het onderzoek in 
nl|als Asian Drama An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations In Denemarken werkte zij als 
nl|consultant voor de regionale overheid en de Voedsel en Landbouworganisatie FAO in Rome Aan de 
nl|hand van gegevens van de FAO kwam zij tot de conclusie dat de verschillende methodes 
nl|van vruchtwisseling en het langdurig braak laten liggen geen aanpassing was aan omgeving of cultuur 
nl|maar afhankelijk was van de bevolkingsdichtheid Boserup ontving een eredoctoraat van de Universiteit van Kopenhagen 
nl|de Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen en de Brownuniversiteit In werd zij lid van de National Academy of 
nl|Sciences In publiceerde Boserup The Conditions of Agricultural Growth The Economics of Agrarian Change Under 
nl|Population Pressure Hierin ging zij in tegen het idee van Malthus en zijn aanhangers dat 
nl|voedselproductie inelastisch is en daarmee een beperkende factor voor de bevolkingsgroei Volgens die visie is 
nl|bevolkingsgroei een afhankelijk variabele die bepaald wordt door de landbouwproductiviteit Die is dan afhankelijk van 
nl|toevallige factor van technische uitvindingen en imitatie die de productiviteit beïnvloeden worden dan gezien als 
nl|bijkomende variabele Boserup draaide dit om en deed haar onderzoek vanuit de aanname dat de 
nl|bevolkingsgroei een onafhankelijke variabele is die een belangrijke factor is in de ontwikkeling van de 
nl|landbouw Zolang er geen noodzaak is zijn er weinig aansporingen om de voedselproductie te verhogen 
nl|Zelfs als uitvindingen bekend zijn worden deze niet noodzakelijk gebruikt zolang de bestaande methodes afdoende 
nl|zijn Pas zodra er tekorten dreigen te ontstaan is de extra inspanning te rechtvaardigen die 
nl|veelal gepaard gaat met agrarische intensivering en de bijbehorende nieuwe manieren van werken Er is 
nl|de nodige kritiek op dit werk van Boserup John Caldwell stelde dat haar theorie waardevol 
nl|was omdat deze de complexiteit weergaf van de invloed van bevolkingsgroei Haar theoretische model van 
nl|landbouwontwikkeling was echter nauwelijks onderbouwd Daarnaast wilde Boserup aantonen dat Malthus en Myrdal er op 
nl|elk vlak naast zaten mede doordat zij sterk gekant was tegen vormen van bevolkingsbeheersing wat 
nl|haar argumenten regelmatig gekunsteld maakte Zo zag zij het sterftecijfer niet als bepalend voor de 
nl|bevolkingsgroei terwijl dit centraal stond bij Malthus De voorbeelden die Boserup gaf waar het sterftecijfer 
nl|geen invloed heeft op bevolkingsgroei lijken selectief en niet universeel Daarnaast stelde Boserup dat omdat 
nl|intensivering een hogere werkdruk zou betekenen dit alleen plaatsvond onder bevolkingsdruk zelfs als innovaties al 
nl|geruime tijd beschikbaar waren Daarmee zou een teruggang waarschijnlijker zijn dan een intensivering Problematisch was 
nl|echter dat die teruggang in de praktijk nauwelijks plaatsvindt waarbij het paleffect mogelijk een rol 
nl|William Darity stelde dat enerzijds de gegevens van Boserup over werkdruk voor voedselvergaring niet deugden 
nl|en anderzijds dat de werkdruk mogelijk aanvankelijk hoger lag maar naarmate de ervaring groeide er 
nl|steeds efficiëntere methodes gevonden Volgens Caldwell had Malthus te weinig oog voor innovatie in de 
nl|landbouw en legde Boserup te veel nadruk op dreigende bestaanscrises als moment om innovaties te 
nl|gaan gebruiken Hoewel Boserup inging tegen Malthus zijn de theorieën met elkaar te verenigen Ronald 
nl|Demos Lee deed dit in en James W Wood in Lee zag het als mogelijk 
nl|dat de theorie van Boserup slechts geldig was binnen een bepaalde bandbreedte waarbij de malthusiaanse 
nl|effecten maken dat de bevolkingsgroei binnen die bandbreedte blijft Nadat Boserup The Conditions of Agricultural 
nl|Growth had geschreven verbleef zij een jaar in Senegal waar haar man leiding gaf aan 
nl|het African Institute for Economic Development and Planning IDEP van de Verenigde Naties Tijdens haar 
nl|eizen door Afrika observeerde zij dat er sprake was van een vooral mannelijke migratie naar 
nl|de steden waarbij de mannen geld naar huis stuurden en de vrouwen achterbleven om voedsel 
nl|te verbouwen Haar daaropvolgende onderzoek resulteerde in in Woman's Role in Economic Development waarmee zij 
nl|bijdroeg aan de discussie over gender en ontwikkeling Hierin ging zij onder meer in tegen 
nl|de stelling van Margaret Mead dat de man het voedsel vergaart terwijl de vrouw het 
nl|bereidt In het eerste deel van het boek onderzocht Boserup de rol van de vrouw 
nl|in verschillende landbouwsamenlevingen Daar waar de vrouw op het land werkt is sprake van een 
nl|bruidsprijs terwijl er een bruidsschat is als de vrouw niet meewerkt Daar waar vrouwen op 
nl|het land werken en gebruiksrechten van land uitgebreid kunnen worden blijft polygamie bestaan Dit mechanisme 
nl|blijkt bepalender te zijn dan welke religie aangehangen wordt Dit werk bracht haar een rol 
nl|in de Commissie voor de status van de vrouw CSW van de Verenigde Naties Daarmee

nl|Het actieve centrum is het gebied van een enzym waaraan het substraat bindt en waar 
nl|de chemische reactie plaatsvindt die het enzym katalyseert Het actieve centrum kan voorgesteld worden als 
nl|een holte in het Het actieve centrum is gevormd naar analogie van de structuur van 
nl|het substraat Als gevolg hiervan kunnen de meeste enzymen alleen een interactie aangaan met een 
nl|specifiek substraatmolecuul Deze specificiteit wordt bepaald door de ruimtelijke ordening van aminozuren binnen het actieve 
nl|centrum Sommige enzymen moeten binden met bepaalde cofactoren om hun passende structuur aan te nemen 
nl|of om een redoxreactie mogelijk te maken In het actieve centrum bevinden zich residuen bepaalde 
nl|aminozuren binnen de polypeptideketen die tijdelijk bindingen aangaan met het substraat Het substraat wordt daardoor 
nl|herkent en vastgehouden Daarnaast zijn er residuen die de reactie van het substraat katalyseren Dit 
nl|zijn de residuen van de zogenaamde katalytische triade Het actieve centrum kan een reactie meermaals 
nl|katalyseren omdat de residuen aan het einde van de reactie onveranderd zijn De residuen kunnen 
nl|tijdens de reactie veranderen maar na afloop worden ze Ondanks dat er grote structuurverschillen bestaan 
nl|tussen individuele enzymen delen de meeste actieve centra een aantal algemene kenmerken Ten eerste bestrijkt 
nl|het actieve centrum slechts een klein deel van het totale Het gaat meestal om een 
nl|in de diepte van het eiwit gelegen ruimte holte waarvan de wanden gevormd worden door 
nl|de zijketens van veelal hydrofobe aminozuurresiduen Het actieve centrum ligt dus goed afgegrensd van het 
nl|cytoplasma waardoor de enzymatische reactie in een optimale fysischchemische omgeving kan optreden Ten tweede berust 
nl|de specificiteit van de enzymatische reactie grotendeels op een nauwkeurig aan het substraat aangepaste vorm 
nl|van het actieve centrum Daar kunnen de atomen van het substraat en enzym elkaar dicht 
nl|genoeg benaderen om nietcovalente interacties met elkaar aan te gaan Bij veel enzymen bevat het 
nl|actieve centrum een ruimtelijke vorm die enigszins beweeglijk is Wanneer deze mobiliteit benut wordt om 
nl|de vorm van het actieve centrum aan die van het subtraat aan te passen spreekt 
nl|men van induced Zodra het substraat is gebonden en georiënteerd aan het actieve centrum kan 
nl|katalyse van de reactie beginnen Door de vrijgekomen energie van de enzymsubstraatbinding kan het subtraat 
nl|tijdelijk tot een andere ruimtelijke conformatie overgaan die de overgangstoestand wordt genoemd De aminozuurzijketens van 
nl|de katalytische triade drie kritische aminozuren en cofactoren zoals NAD leveren de elektronen of waterstofionen 
nl|die nodig zijn voor de chemische reactie Na de reactie wordt meestal een tweede overgangstoestand

nl|marginale groepen centraal Naar verloop van tijd signaleerde hij echter een wereldwijde tendens richting revanchisme 
nl|in stedelijk beleid en stadsontwikkeling Volgens Smith is stedelijk revanchisme een bijproduct van gentrificatie het 
nl|proces waarin een stadsdeel of buurt in economische sociale en culturele zin wordt opgewaardeerd door 
nl|hernieuwde interesse en vestiging van midden en hogere inkomensgroepen Om deze kapitaalkrachtige groepen voor de 
nl|stad te winnen of te behouden worden andere groepen die minder welvarend of anderszins afstotend 
nl|voor de beoogde doelgroep zouden kunnen zijn verjaagd Dit gebeurt niet alleen door de stijging 
nl|van de prijzen van het onroerend goed maar ook door privatisering van en verscherpt toezicht 
nl|op de openbare ruimte Smith signaleert in dit verband een ontwikkeling waarin verzorgingsarrangementen zoals sociale 
nl|woningbouw werkgelegenheidsprogramma's daklozenopvang et cetera worden afgebouwd ten gunste van commercialisering en economische revitalisering van 
nl|binnensteden De geldigheid van Smiths bewering dat het hier om een wereldwijd verschijnsel gaat staat

nl|nieuwe weg uittekent voor de hedendaagse filosofie verschillend van Immanuel Kants drie alternatieven van criticisme 
nl|scepticisme en In dit boek stelt Meillassoux dat de filosofie na Kant gedomineerd wordt door 
nl|wat Meillassoux noemt "correlationisme" dat de idee beschrijft dat de mens niet zonder de wereld 
nl|kan bestaan noch de wereld zonder de Meillassoux stelt echter dat dit een oneerlijke stap 
nl|is waardoor de filosofie het probleem van hoe de wereld te beschrijven zoals hij echt 
nl|is aan de kant kan zetten In navolging van Badiou en diens interesse voor wiskunde 
nl|stelt Meillassoux dat we juist met de wiskunde de primaire eigenschappen als uitgebreidheid massa van 
nl|de wereld kunnen bereiken in tegenstelling tot de waarneming die enkel die secundaire kwaliteiten als 
nl|kleur geur bereikt Daarnaast probeert Meillassoux ook aan te tonen dat men dit "agnostisch scepticisme" 
nl|dat stelt dat we niet zeker kunnen weten of er wel zoiets is als oorzakelijkheid 
nl|moeten omzetten in de radicale zekerheid dat zoiets als oorzakelijkheid in het geheel niet bestaat 
nl|Hij stelt verder dat hieruit volgt dat het eigenlijk noodzakelijk is dat alle natuurwetten contingent 
nl|zijn De wereld is een soort van grote chaos waarin de wet van de toereikende 
nl|grond moet worden verlaten hoewel de wet van de noncontradictie nog wel geldt Om deze 
nl|redenen verwerpt Meillassoux de klassieke metafoor van Kants Copernicaanse revolutie in de filosofie Het is 
nl|immers net Kant die de wereld doet afhangen van de wijze waarop de mens haar 
nl|observeert wat resulteerde in het Duits idealisme Meillassoux spreekt dan ook over Kants werk als

nl|die speelde tussen en Het betrof de moord die in werd gepleegd door de toen 
nl|Boudewijn Henny zijn broer Ewout Henny en hun vriend Hennie Werkhoven op de toen Theo 
nl|Mastwijk uit Soest De broers Henny kwamen uit een vooraanstaande Baarnse familie Het lichaam van 
nl|het slachtoffer werd eind oktober gevonden De zaak diende anderhalf jaar later voor de rechtbank 
nl|te Utrecht van maandag tot en met vrijdag maart Het lichaam van Theo Mastwijk werd 
nl|op vrijdag oktober bij toeval gevonden door een metselaar die een oude beerput leeg schepte 
nl|in de tuin van Huize Canton een kapitale Baarnse villa waar het gezin Henny woonde 
nl|Tevens was in het pand het familiebedrijf gevestigd een groot verzekeringsbedrijf dat was opgericht door 
nl|de overgrootvader van Boudewijn en Ewout en waarvan hun vader in die tijd directeureigenaar was 
nl|Onderzoek wees uit dat het slachtoffer ongeveer een jaar daarvoor omgebracht was; later kwam aan 
nl|het licht dat de moord gepleegd was op de avond van augustus Daarna werd zijn 
nl|lichaam in de put met ongebluste kalk bedekt waardoor het ontbindingsproces werd versneld zodat slechts 
nl|gebeente werd gevonden De Telegraaf publiceerde op november een voorpaginaartikel dat een nauwkeurige tijdlijn suggereert 
nl|van de moord … werd de oude … reeds blootgelegd en geopend vóórdat deze Theo 
nl|Mastwijk red om het leven gebracht werd En ongebluste kalk werd weinige uren vóór de 
nl|moord gestolen bij een Baarnse leverancier van De begrafenis van Theo Mastwijk vond plaats op 
nl|november Zo kort na de vondst van het lichaam kon de werkelijke overlijdensdatum niet direct 
nl|worden vastgesteld op het graf werd augustus aangegeven Later bleek dat de werkelijke sterfdag moest 
nl|worden bepaald op augustus De 'Baarnse moordzaak' beheerste maandenlang het nieuws Al snel werd geoordeeld 
nl|dat er sprake zou zijn van klassenjustitie Allereerst omdat de verdachte Boudewijn tijdens het voorarrest 
nl|kon ontsnappen uit het Baarnse politiebureau en vervolgens na twee dagen gewoon thuis bleek te 
nl|zitten Officier van justitie mr Overbeek kwam hem met zijn privéauto persoonlijk ophalen en reed 
nl|hem naar het politiebureau waarna deze officier in de landelijke pers een lawine van beschuldigingen 
nl|over zich kreeg In justitiële kringen meenden sommigen dat de officier daarbij juist had gehandeld 
nl|omdat het hier ging om een jeugdige verdachte Niettemin kwamen er Kamervragen en kreeg Overbeek 
nl|een berisping van minister van Justitie ACW Beerman Bovendien ging het om 'rijkeluisdaders' miljonairszonen; hun 
nl|vader was directeur van verzekeringsmaatschappij Conservatrix die zich moesten verantwoorden voor de moord op een 
nl|jongen uit een lager sociaal milieu Indertijd viel op dat de broers tijdens hun straf 
nl|anders werden behandeld dan andere delinquenten Zo mochten ze tijdens het uitzitten van hun straf 
nl|met vakantie en werden ze zeilend op het water gezien Dat inspireerde Gerard Cox in 
nl|het liedje Een broekje in de branding tot een verwijzing in de tekst Dobbert het 
nl|aan tegen een miljonair of bollebof of tegen een welgestelde delinquent met zeilverlof Op april 
nl|wees de arrondissementsrechtbank Utrecht vonnis in de Baarnse Voor het medeplegen van moord en diefstal 
nl|werden Boudewijn Henny en Hennie Werkhoven veroordeeld tot negen jaar gevangenisstraf Zij werden daarnaast aan 
nl|de regering ter beschikking gesteld om van overheidswege te worden verpleegd Bij de straftoemeting hield 
nl|de rechtbank rekening met de jeugdige leeftijd jaar van het slachtoffer en de gruwelijke wijze 
nl|waarop de moord was uitgevoerd terwijl Ewout op de uitkijk stond lokten Boudewijn en Hennie 
nl|Mastwijk de woning uit met de smoes dat hij zich moest wassen en ze hem 
nl|dan over de grens zouden brengen Vervolgens werd Mastwijk van achteren met een snoer gewurgd 
nl|en daarna met een hakmes de schedel ingeslagen waarna hij met hoofd eerst de put 
nl|in is geduwd die vervolgens meteen werd gedempt Tegenover deze feiten plaatste de rechtbank het 
nl|gegeven dat Henny en Werkhoven ten tijde van het plegen van de moord zelf pas 
nl|respectievelijk jaar oud waren en dat enig volwassen toezicht in de aanloop naar de moord 
nl|geheel afwezig was De rechtbank oordeelde dat sprake was van complotdenken door het drietal dat 
nl|door ouders of andere volwassenen mogelijk had kunnen worden doorbroken De TBS met dwangverpleging werd 
nl|opgelegd vanwege de constatering van een gebrekkige ontwikkeling van de geestvermogens en een ziekelijke stoornis 
nl|Ewout Henny werd wegens medeplichtigheid aan de moord en wegens het medeplegen van diefstal veroordeeld 
nl|tot zes jaar gevangenisstraf en TBS met dwangverpleging Ook bij hem werd onder meer rekening 
nl|gehouden met zijn jeugdige leeftijd jaar ten tijde van de moord Om voor Hennie Werkhoven 
nl|een goede advocaat te kunnen bekostigen was een geldinzameling gehouden onder burgers van Baarn en 
nl|Soest die circa gulden opbracht Tijdens het proces beschuldigden de verdachten over en weer elkaar 
nl|ervan Theo Mastwijk met een hakmes de schedel te hebben ingeslagen De drie hebben twee 
nl|derde van hun straffen uitgezeten Tijdens de detentie en daarna hebben zij alle drie met 
nl|onder meer de hulp van de reclassering hun studies kunnen voltooien Niet alleen voor de 
nl|broers maar ook voor mededader Hennie Werkhoven werden daartoe programma's opgesteld Het was in die 
nl|tijd gebruikelijk dat gedetineerden tijdens de gevangenschap konden werken aan hun latere terugkeer in de 
nl|maatschappij De ware geschiedenis van deze zaak is tot nu toe nog nooit geheel beschreven 
nl|De enige beschikbare bronnen zijn de krantenverslagen en commentaren uit de periode dat de moord 
nl|werd ontdekt oktober en dat het proces plaatsvond maart Daarbij wordt duidelijk wat de aanloop 
nl|was en hoe de moord heeft plaatsgevonden Maar het is niet openbaar hoe de vijf 
nl|weken verliepen voor de moord waarbij het viertal de broers Hennie en het slachtoffer bivakkeerden 
nl|op de zolder van de villa Dit werd uitgebreid onderzocht in de periode van het 
nl|voorarrest als aanloop naar het proces in maart De omvangrijke rapporten van psychiaters psychologen en 
nl|de reclassering werden als gevolg van strikte beginselen van het strafprocesrecht tijdens de zitting niet 
nl|aan de openbaarheid prijsgegeven Ook later zijn de betreffende dossiers nooit openbaar gemaakt Dat is 
nl|er de oorzaak van dat een aantal creatieve auteurs hun fantasie de vrije loop gaven 
nl|en met het verhaal aan de haal gingen In dook wel een politiefotoreconstructieboek op dat 
nl|in handen kwam van het nieuwsprogramma EenVandaag In het boek dat eigenlijk vernietigd had moeten 
nl|worden is te zien hoe naast politieacteurs twee van de drie daders de moord Kort 
nl|na het proces verscheen allereerst van K Beerman pseudoniem het boekje Baarnse moord uitgeverij De 
nl|Kennemer De schrijver had het proces niet bijgewoond en beschikte ook niet over primaire bronnen 
nl|Hij stelde een verhaal samen uit enkele van de vele krantenverslagen aangevuld met sfeertekeningen Volgens 
nl|krantenberichten uit die tijd werden er in korte tijd zo'n exemplaren van verkocht maar er 
nl|kwamen ook berichten dat de vader van de broers de gehele of nog resterende oplage 
nl|had opgekocht om deze te kunnen Daarna verscheen een drietal literaire werken waarbij de auteurs 
nl|zich door de 'plot' van de moord hadden laten inspireren vier pubers een zich ontwikkelend 
nl|drama cumulerend in een moord Dit resulteerde in enkele psychologische romans waarbij de auteurs ieder 
nl|op hun eigen wijze de omringende feiten inkleurden Eerst kwam de romanschrijver Johan Fabricius die 
nl|als journalist het proces had bijgewoond met Jongensspel Den Haag uitgeverij Leopold Van het slachtoffer 
nl|Theo maakte hij een doortrapte schlemiel en van Hennie Werkhoven een meeloper die in het 
nl|drama was meegesleurd door de rijke broers De jongste broer zou alles hebben bedacht en 
nl|de oudste zou de moord hebben gepleegd Fabricius paste de beschrijvingen van de karakters navenant 
nl|aan en beschreef de jongens zodanig dat zij makkelijk herkenbaar waren In De Volkskrant werd 
nl|daarop dit boek flink onderuitgehaald Het grote publiek zou immers hierdoor de indruk krijgen dat 
nl|Jongensspel de ware geschiedenis beschreef hetgeen geenszins het geval was Als tweede was het de 
nl|auteurpsychiater Manuel van Loggem die een toneelstuk schreef naar aanleiding van de moord getiteld Jeugdproces 
nl|Amsterdam De Bezige Bij Zo'n twintig jaar later liet Thomas Rosenboom zich door de zaak 
nl|inspireren tot de psychologische roman Vriend van verdienste Amsterdam Querido Zijn boek kreeg de meeste 
nl|bekendheid Het kan evenmin gezien worden als een documentaire over de zaak Rosenboom kon als 
nl|romanschrijver ook zijn fantasie en creativiteit alle kanten op laten gaan Zo maakte hij onder 
nl|meer de vier jongens allen twee jaar ouder dan in werkelijkheid het geval was waardoor 
nl|zijn roman meer handelt over een groepje jonge mannen dan over een stel tieners in 
nl|hun puberteit In het najaar van werd deze moordzaak verfilmd onder de titel met in 
nl|de hoofdrollen Matthijs van de Sande Bakhuyzen Erik van Heijningen Derk Stenvers en Sander van 
nl|Amsterdam Pierre Bokma en Carolien Spoor vertolken Voor de totstandkoming van deze film lieten de 
nl|makers zich voornamelijk inspireren door de roman van Rosenboom De film is uiteraard fictie en 
nl|regisseur Arno Dierickx stelde dat hij er met zijn scenarioschrijvers en producent een eigen verhaal 
nl|van heeft willen maken Terecht waarschuwt hij dat het publiek nu niet moet denken de 
nl|ware geschiedenis voorgeschoteld te krijgen In de film gaat het vooral om de vijf weken 
nl|voorafgaande aan de moord toen het viertal gezamenlijk bivakkeerde op de zolder van de villa

nl|het Merchants Coffee House Gedurende de geschiedenis van de beurs zou deze verschillende malen in 
nl|de stad verhuizen Zo was de beurs tussen en gevestigd in de voormalige First Bank 
nl|of the United States In vestigde de beurs zich uiteindelijk in haar huidige pand In 
nl|In diverse landen kende men eeuwenlang een algemene verhuisdag ook wel vaste verhuisdag genoemd Vaak 
nl|was dat op mei maar er kwamen ook andere datums voor De algemene verhuisdag was 
nl|een direct gevolg van het feit dat contracten meestal op mei begonnen of eindigden Wisselde 
nl|men van baas vrijwillig of noodgedwongen dan moest men meestal ook verhuizen Dat gold vroeger 
nl|vooral voor boeren en landarbeiders En omdat ook de huren per mei konden worden opgezegd 
nl|was er op die dag elk jaar een piek in verhuizingen de algemene De eerste 
nl|mei als contractdatum en betaaldatum in onze streken is al heel oud De oude term 
nl|meye of meye daghe betekende mei De Hollandse graaf verpachtte in een erf in Dordrecht 
nl|voor schelling per jaar te betalen alle jare ene helft te sinte Baven daghe oktober 
nl|ende die ander helft te meye Maar ook als het om andere afspraken ging hield 
nl|men vaak mei aan als afrekendag Bij een geschil tussen kooplieden uit Stavoren en Lübeck 
nl|in besliste de graaf dat die van Lübeck de toegebrachte schade moesten vergoeden en betalen 
nl|op den eersten Meye dach in In verlengde de graaf de vrede tussen Holland en 
nl|de Oostvriesen van Meye dach in ’t jahre tot Meye dach in ’t jahre Vanuit 
nl|Holland en WestFriesland gezien lag aan de andere kant van de Zuiderzee OostFriesland Voor huurhuizen 
nl|in de stad was er meestal niet een direct verband tussen arbeidscontract en huishuur Daarom 
nl|werden er al vroeg regels gemaakt om huurders toch op de vaste wisseldatum uit het 
nl|huis te krijgen In een Amsterdamse keur van staat De gene die in Huerhuysen wonen 
nl|ende anderswaer sullen alle jaer vervaren op ter Meye avond by schellingen Hollands elcx dage 
nl|te verbeuren; ’t en sy dat sy langer verwerven mogen aen dengenen die de huysen 
nl|Met andere woorden wie weigerde per mei zijn huurhuis te ontruimen kreeg een boete van 
nl|schellingen per dag tenzij met de eigenaar verlenging van het huurcontract was afgesproken Wanneer mei 
nl|op zondag viel werd in Nederland de algemene verhuisdag een dag eerder of later gehouden 
nl|In Amsterdam werd bovendien niet verhuisd op vrijdag zaterdag en maandag Vrijdag en maandag omdat 
nl|het belangrijke marktdagen waren zaterdag vanwege de Joodse sjabbat Dat laatste was niet altijd vanzelfsprekend 
nl|geweest In viel mei op zondag en de verhuisdag werd daarom gesteld op zaterdag april 
nl|Dat was niet een gewone sjabbat het was ook Pesach het Joodse paasfeest Er was 
nl|een kort geding nodig om de verhuisdag te verschuiven naar mei Mede onder invloed van 
nl|de Franse Revolutie vrijheid gelijkheid broederschap was in de tussenkomst van een rechter niet meer 
nl|nodig In werd door paus Gregorius XIII een verbeterde kalender afgekondigd Na oktober volgens keizer 
nl|Julius Caesar was het de volgende dag oktober volgens paus Gregorius De lente zou in 
nl|het vervolg weer op maart beginnen en Pasen Pinksteren en alle andere kerkelijke feestdagen zouden 
nl|weer op de juiste dagen vallen Katholieke landen voerden de kalender meteen in maar protestantse 
nl|landen voelden zich niet gebonden aan deze pauselijke kalender Voor de internationale handel waren twee 
nl|kalenders natuurlijk lastig en Holland en Zeeland volgden al snel het voorbeeld van de katholieke 
nl|zuidelijke Nederlanden Andere gewesten van de republiek volgden pas na Toen was het verschil tussen 
nl|beide kalenders opgelopen tot elf dagen Na december was de volgende dag januari Wie per 
nl|mei een jaarcontract had gesloten zou als het op de nieuwe kalender mei werd elf 
nl|dagen kwijt zijn Een huurder zou elf dagen eerder uit zijn huis moeten een verhuurder 
nl|zou minder dan de volle jaarhuur vangen De Friezen vonden het onbillijk om met terugwerkende 
nl|kracht een contract te veranderen Het volgens afspraak handhaven van het volle recht en het 
nl|volle genot vonden ze belangrijker En dus bleef de huurder dagen in zijn huis In 
nl|een officiële publicatie van januari werd het bevestigd ‘possessie en gebruik der landen sal expireren 
nl|op den vijfden Martij en van de huijsen soo in de Steden als ten Platten 
nl|Lande alsmede de verhuijsinge en het vervaren van Dienstboden soo Knechten als Meijden met den 
nl|elfden Meij en November’ Zo bleef in deze provincie mei de ingangsdatum voor het huren 
nl|van knechten en dienstmeiden en voor verhuizingen Dit maatschappelijk gebruik werd in door de Friese 
nl|Staten wettig verklaard Het gebruiken van twee kalenders binnen de republiek der zeven verenigde Nederlanden 
nl|betekende dat men bij de datum moest vermelden of het oude of nieuwe stijl was 
nl|Het gaf ook specifieke problemen Als een Friese dienstbode naar Holland wilde moest ze daar 
nl|per mei beginnen terwijl haar oude dienstje nog tot mei doorliep Binnen Nederland viel de 
nl|algemene verhuisdag niet overal op of mei In Scheveningen dicteerde de visserij de verhuisdag Er 
nl|was geen vaste datum meestal viel hij ergens in juni als de hele vissersvloot aan 
nl|wal lag In Gooi en Eemland wisselden knechten en meiden op Sint Katrijn november Daar 
nl|had men bovendien het gebruik dat iedereen in de nacht van op november de nog 
nl|in het veld lopende koeien mocht melken Dus werden ze zoveel mogelijk eerder op stal 
nl|gezet Met Sint Katrijn moeten de koeien aan de lijn In Limburg verhuisde men op 
nl|maart de dag waarop de negenjarige pachtcontracten van de boerderijen vervielen De algemene verhuisdag was 
nl|een wereldwijd fenomeen In de en eeuw kwamen er in de steden geleidelijk meer verhuisdagen 
nl|bij omdat er voor de huishuur behalve jaartermijnen ook half jaar kwartaal en maandtermijnen werden 
nl|ingevoerd Maar de drukste verhuisdag bleef die op de voorjaarsdatum Het Belgische Leuven had maart 
nl|Berlijn april en oktober Parijs april juli oktober en januari Londen had er eind eeuw 
nl|al vier de drukste was Lady Day maart verder Midsummerday juni Michaelmasday september en Christmasday 
nl|december Het Italiaanse Napels deed mee met mei maar Milaan verhuisde op september Sint Michielsdag 
nl|Kopenhagen verhuisde op oktober Wenen op augustus het Spaanse Baskenland op december Lissabon op januari 
nl|en juli betaling vooraf op november en mei Stockholm op oktober en Zwitserland verhuisde op 
nl|april en oktober In Amerika bleef mei moving day ook nadat de Engelsen NieuwAmsterdam hadden 
nl|omgedoopt tot New York en die gewoonte hield daar stand tot In de eeuw begonnen 
nl|buitenlandcorrespondenten in kranten over de algemene verhuisdag daar te schrijven Het ging vaak over de 
nl|enorme drukte op straat Parijs Het is de gewone verhuisdag voor personen van de mindere 
nl|stand Het schouwspel maakte veeleer de indruk van een algemene volksverhuizing of emigratie Londen De 
nl|drukte in de stad is net als bij jullie en degenen die verhuizen leven weken 
nl|en maanden in een chaos Volgens de correspondent uit Berlijn maart verhuisde men daar gemakkelijk 
nl|Kachels stonden vast in een huis en hoefden dus niet mee Men gebuikte op de 
nl|vloer losse tapijten en men woonde gelijkvloers en dus hoefde men niet te rekenen met 
nl|trappen voorhuizen binnenplaatsen enz De correspondent in New York noemde mei in een zwarte duivelse 
nl|dag Het leek of half New York verhuisde Hij schetste de Amerikaan als iemand die 
nl|niet aan een huis is gehecht De Amerikaan kende het Hollandse spreekwoord niet drie maal 
nl|verhuisd staat gelijk aan eenmaal afgebrand Volgens een legende zou het gebruik om op mei 
nl|te verhuizen door de eerste Hollandse volksplanters van de duivel zijn overgenomen In Limburg heette 
nl|de boerenverhuisdag op de tweede donderdag na Pasen ook wel Allerduvelendag Het ligt voor de 
nl|hand dat de eerste Nederlandse emigranten hun verhuisgewoonten meenamen Daar hadden ze de duivel niet 
nl|voor nodig In New York moest uiterlijk op februari Rent Day de huur worden opgezegd 
nl|zodat men drie maanden de tijd had om een nieuw onderkomen te vinden Op deze 
nl|gewoonte werd door New York State een wettelijke regeling gebaseerd die inhield dat als er 
nl|geen einddatum was vastgesteld in een huurcontract dit per definitie mei was In werd in 
nl|de wet het verhogen van huren aan voorwaarden gebonden en dit leidde ertoe samen met 
nl|het huizentekort na de Tweede Wereldoorlog dat moving day verdween In was in Frans Canada 
nl|Quebec in de wet vastgelegd dat landheren de pachters niet van hun land mochten zetten 
nl|voordat de sneeuw was gesmolten Als vervolg daarop werd in in het burgerlijk wetboek bepaald 
nl|dat de pachttermijnen liepen van mei tot april Daarmee werd ook daar mei de nationale 
nl|verhuisdag op z’n Frans ‘fête du déménagement’ feest der verhuizing De regering van Quebec besloot 
nl|in dat het beter was om de verhuisdag naar de zomer te verschuiven Zo konden 
nl|schoolkinderen het schooljaar afmaken en bovendien was het op mei in Canada vaak nog ruig 
nl|weer Men koos voor juli de algemene vrije feestdag Canada day want dan hoefden de 
nl|laagstbetaalden voor hun verhuizing geen onbetaald verlof op te nemen Op die dag verhuizen nog 
nl|altijd honderdduizenden mensen die langs de straat een spoor van overbodige meubelstukken en lege dozen 
nl|achterlaten Op de algemene verhuisdag kwam overal de woningnood schrijnend aan het licht In bleven 
nl|in Berlijn gezinnen over zonder woning In schreven Deense kranten over de ellende van dakloze 
nl|gezinnen na de verhuisdag op oktober In Nederland kwam vooral de woningnood in Friesland aan 
nl|de orde In Sneek konden in veertien gezinnen geen andere woning vinden De armvoogdij deed 
nl|zijn best om onderdak te verzorgen maar eind mei bivakkeerden nog tien gezinnen onder de 
nl|blote hemel zonder uitzicht op een oplossing Na mei stonden in Friesland minstens gezinnen op 
nl|straat De tijdelijke oplossingen waren soms bizar Heerenveen had als noodoplossing een houten loods bij 
nl|de vuilnisbelt als tijdelijk onderkomen ingericht Hij was met manshoge schotten in woningen verdeeld waardoor 
nl|iedereen goed kon horen wat er bij de buren gebeurde Met gevoel voor ironie had 
nl|men deze loods Villa Zonder Zorg gedoopt In had een moeder met kinderen geen ander 
nl|alternatief dan zelf slapen op een handkar en de kinderen eronder met als dekens oude 
nl|zakken In zochten gezinnen in Wonseradeel tijdelijk onderdak in lege schuurtjes waar in de winter 
nl|vlas was bewerkt de zogenoemde braakhokken In Harlingen stonden in er liefhebbers voor een bepaalde 
nl|woning De eigenaar lootte er eerst zes man uit en liet die vervolgens om de 
nl|woning dobbelen Gewoonlijk huurden pachtboeren alleen het land Ze waren eigenaar van het huis de 
nl|schuur de werktuigen en het vee Als de landeigenaar de huur opzegde moest hij de 
nl|gebouwen tegen taxatiewaarde aan zijn pachter vergoeden De inboedel en het vee nam de pachter 
nl|op de vaste verhuisdag mee naar zijn nieuwe bedrijf Voor het land golden andere vervaldatums 
nl|die waren afgestemd op de gunstigste periodes voor zaaien en maaien Meestal was dat Sint 
nl|Petrus februari nieuwe stijl maart Sommige boeren wilden de zomerrogge beslist inzaaien op die dag 
nl|voor ’s middags uur in de overtuiging dat later gezaaide zaadjes slechtere aren zouden produceren 
nl|Voor bouwland werd de datum soms nog verder naar voren gehaald het moment in het 
nl|najaar waarop het gewas van de oude pachter geoogst was Zodoende had de nieuwe pachter 
nl|dan de gelegenheid op tijd een wintergewas in te zaaien Sint Petrus als pachtwisseldatum voor 
nl|de landerijen stamt al uit de middeleeuwen Toen in de hertog van Saksen enkele Hollandse 
nl|edelen de Bildlanden liet bedijken mochten ze dat land gebruiken of verpachten maar dan wel 
nl|volgens de Friese gebruiken soo sich met pachtgoederen in onsen Vrieslande rechten gewoon De pacht 
nl|van het land moest beginnen op Sint Petri dach in Cathedra want voor het tijdig 
nl|inzaaien was mei te laat Verhuizen had voor een boer nogal wat voeten in aarde 
nl|Het vervoeren van de huiselijke inboedel het vee en het landbouwmateriaal wagens rijtuigen ploeg eg 
nl|etc vergde heel wat organisatie Hulp van anderen was daarbij hard nodig en in de 
nl|loop der eeuwen waren daar gewoonten voor ontwikkeld In veel gebieden was burenhulp dan ook 
nl|heel normaal en heel vaak waren het de toekomstige buren Zo was die hulp onderdeel 
nl|van een effectief inburgeringsritueel De nieuwe boer moest tijdig laten weten dat hij op de 
nl|verhuisdag zou arriveren Vroeg in de ochtend gingen de nieuwe buren op pad met paarden 
nl|en wagens om hem op te halen Ze namen knechten en meiden mee Eerst hielpen 
nl|die bij het opladen van de inboedel en daarna dreven ze het vee naar de 
nl|nieuwe woonplaats Dat leverde een lange karavaan op van beladen wagens en kudden dieren Als 
nl|de afstand tussen de oude en nieuwe woonplaats nogal groot was vertrokken de helpers al 
nl|in de voorafgaande nacht De kasteleins van herbergen waar ze pauzeerden moesten voor de paarden 
nl|een armvol gras geven Op de terugweg herhaalde zich dit ritueel en met elke pauze 
nl|werd de stemming vrolijker door de vloeibare verteringen die de mannen naar binnen sloegen De 
nl|betaling aan de herbergiers was voor rekening van de verhuizende boer en zijn reputatie in 
nl|het nieuwe dorp werd bepaalde door de correctheid waarmee die nota’s werden betaald Als de 
nl|nieuwe boer alles enigszins op orde had werden de helpers uitgenodigd voor een uitgebreide maaltijd 
nl|met koffie maar vooral ook met sterke drank Een dergelijk verhuisritueel kwam in diverse Nederlandse 
nl|streken voor met op onderdelen afwijkende gebruiken In Limburg en Brabant was de boerenverhuisdag een 
nl|glorieus voorjaarsfestijn zoals dat in de rest van Nederland nauwelijks voorkwam Alleen in de Achterhoek 
nl|waar de boeren op Sint Pieter februari verhuisden kende men iets van de zuidelijke feestelijkheid 
nl|Die bestond daar vooral uit het rondgaan van de drankfles en het luidruchtig zingen van 
nl|We gaan verhuizen wie gaat er mee Ten zuiden van de grote rivieren was het 
nl|echt feest De jonge dochters van de toekomstige buren versierden de kar van het verhuizende 
nl|gezin met groene slingers en papieren roosjes Onderweg zongen de jongelui verhuisliederen en eentje daarvan 
nl|is nog in heel Nederland bekend Dat gaat naar Den Bosch toe In de teksten 
nl|van tegenwoordig is de relatie met de verhuisdag verdwenen maar die was er vroeger wel 
nl|degelijk Wie zal dat betalen zoete lieve Gerritje de boer die wij gaan halen zoete 
nl|lieve meid Andere vragen die Gerritje moest beantwoorden luidden wat zullen wij daar drinken en 
nl|wat zullen wij daar eten en die verwijzen naar de gemeenschappelijke maaltijd die de buren 
nl|in de nieuwe woonplaats zou worden aangeboden De antwoorden waren zoet brandewijn met suiker en 
nl|rijstepap met suiker De algemene verhuisdag is bijna overal verleden tijd In Friesland hield de 
nl|contractdatum voor boerenarbeiders per mei wat langer stand dan de algemene verhuisdag In de jaren 
nl|was het nog heel gewoon dat er boerenknechten werden gevraagd per mei Er werden wel 
nl|moderne eisen gesteld zoals goed kunnende hand en machinemelken In de jaren werd mei een

nl|De oudGriekse magie is het geheel van magische praktijken en bijbehorende ideeën van de oude 
nl|Grieken Die hebben hun wortels in prehistorische en preGriekse tijden en ze bewegen zich steeds 
nl|tussen wetenschap en religie in Magie was bij de Grieken algemeen bekend kende diverse vormen 
nl|en toepassingen maar werd vaak tevens als obscuur en verkeerd beschouwd Net als de godsdienst 
nl|was ook Griekse magie het resultaat van assimilatie en syncretisme en stamt uit prehistorische tijden 
nl|Invloeden en tradities uit de kopertijd en bronstijd zouden het taboe verklaren op het gebruik 
nl|van ijzeren messen bij rituelen Dat tovenaressen als Circe en Medea negatief werden voorgesteld en 
nl|magiërs met een schuin oog werden aangekeken kan verklaard worden uit de conflicten die ontstaan 
nl|bij het botsen en gestaag versmelten van twee culturen Dat zou bijvoorbeeld betekenen dat Medea's 
nl|kennis van magische ingrediënten teruggaat op preHelleense priestertraining of het gaat om een preGriekse Daar 
nl|komt bij dat de Grieken de oorsprong van magie en heksen buiten Griekenland legden Zij 
nl|zou haar oorsprong hebben in het oude Perzië en aldaar zijn uitgevonden door Het Griekse 
nl|woord voor 'magiër' magos is dan ook van Perzische afkomst Heksen zouden afkomstig zijn uit 
nl|Thessalië of kustgebieden langs de Zwarte Zee toentertijd het einde van de beschaafde Zoals men 
nl|later ook in middeleeuwse magische recepten zal zien rekent men reeds in de klassieke oudheid 
nl|in de eerste plaats magische kruiden tot het repertoire van heksen samen met toverspreuken Latijn 
nl|carmina en in mindere mate stenen Soms tevens allerlei menselijke en dierlijke materialen zoals vers 
nl|bloed een tong of botten Het benutten van dergelijke organische materialen is niet vreemd aangezien 
nl|sommige dieren in de oudheid bepaalde bijzondere eigenschappen toegedicht kregen Zo baseert Plinius de Oudere 
nl|zich op veel en op oudere bronnen bij zijn Naturalis historia waarin hij het wonderbaarlijke 
nl|vermogen van urine van de lynx beschrijft Magie kende men in verschillende vormen en wordt 
nl|al in een vroeg stadium in de Griekse literatuur beschreven Zo kende men het dodenorakel 
nl|verbonden aan de algemeen verbreide overtuiging dat de doden als schimmen voortleefden en de toekomst 
nl|konden voorspellen zoals voorkomt in Homerus' Veelvoorkomend is de zogeheten bindingsspreuk Latijn defixiones die een 
nl|godheid aanriepen voor een bepaalde persoon Vaak werden bindingsspreuken gebruikt in noodgevallen bijvoorbeeld voor het 
nl|winnen van een wedstrijd of rechtszaak bij ambachtsconcurrentie of een vete Ook kende magie een 
nl|agrarische dimensie spreuken konden ingezet worden om oogst en gewassen van een veld naar een 
nl|ander te verplaatsen Verder kende men nog liefdesmagie en magie in de vorm van genezingsrituelen 
nl|Gedurende de Romeinse keizertijd werden bepaalde rituelen binnen de waarzeggerij ook geassocieerd met De Grieken 
nl|kenden de vormen van voorspelling onder de term mantike Een god of bovennatuurlijk wezen wordt 
nl|door middel van gebeden of spreuken gevraagd om tussenbeide te komen ten behoeve van de 
nl|persoon die het gebed uit Een theoretisch verschil is voor sommigen echter zijn dat een 
nl|gebed van een gelovige gericht is aan een godheid met een onafhankelijke wil die al 
nl|dan niet het verzoek kan inwilligen terwijl dit bij magie anders is Een dergelijk onderscheid 
nl|treft men bijvoorbeeld bij de Romein Lucanus eerste eeuw aan In de Codex Theodosianus vele 
nl|wetteksten verzameld door een commissie in opdracht van Theodosius II werd het raadplegen van een 
nl|magiër verboden en kregen magiebeoefenaars de doodstraf opgelegd Keizer Augustus vChr nChr toonde een dubbele 
nl|houding ten aanzien van magie Hij liet enerzijds grote hoeveelheden toverboeken verbranden anderzijds was hij 
nl|tevreden over de voorspellingen van zijn eigen magiërs Keizer Claudius liet de magiërs verbannen tenzij 
nl|ze op het keizerlijk hof bleven De reden voor het vijandig beleid is dat magische 
nl|teksten potentieel crimineel of staatsgevaarlijk Paradoxaal genoeg was er in met name de eerste eeuw 
nl|na Christus een duidelijke markt voor magie zoals blijkt uit het werk van Tacitus Seneca 
nl|de tragedies Medea en Oedipus en Lucanus Dat neemt evenwel niet weg dat in veel 
nl|gevallen er een bepaalde vorm van magie als 'verkeerd' tegenover een bepaalde vorm van magie 
nl|als 'juist' geplaatst wordt Zo beschouwt Lucanus in zijn Pharsalia het dodenorakel en 'gerommel' met 
nl|geesten en lijken als misdadig terwijl erkende vormen van waarzeggerij en orakels zoals het befaamde 
nl|Orakel van Delphi dat duidelijk niet zijn Het verschil zit hem erin dat bij laatstgenoemden 
nl|de goden niet gedwongen worden maar nederig verzocht worden terwijl 'hekserij' de goden verplicht tot 
nl|particuliere Belangrijk voor de latere ontwikkeling van magie in het westen is het feit dat 
nl|magie vanaf de tweede eeuw mengt met filosofie terwijl filosofie weer richting religie beweegt en 
nl|Dat is te zien bij het hermetisme neopythagorisme en neoplatonisme bijvoorbeeld onder invloed van Plotinus 
nl|en Jamblichus ca ca Hun neoplatonische kosmologie waarin de kosmos werd voorgesteld als één groot 
nl|harmonieus verbonden geheel werd daarbij verbonden met uitgewerkte rituelen om goden aan te roepen en 
nl|in te zetten om de eigen magische krachten te Dit noemt men theürgie waarvan de 
nl|vroegste bron de Chaldeïsche Orakelen zijn tweede eeuw Tegelijkertijd groeide echter ook de associatie van 
nl|magie met demonische krachten Kerkvaders zoals Augustinus hadden vanzelfsprekend moeite met theürgie maar werden toch 
nl|geïnspireerd door het neoplatonische Verwijzingen naar magie kunnen verder nog gevonden worden in De Staat 
nl|van Plato over de Ring van Gyges De gouden ezel van Apuleius en de De 
nl|vitae caesarum van Suetonius Augustus Een van de Idyllen van Theokritos eerste helft derde eeuw 
nl|vChr staat ook geheel in het teken van magie het betreft liefdesmagie ingezet door een

nl|volgelingen wordt hij vaak aangeduid als 'papa' Hagin Volgens Hagins eigen getuigenis leed hij als 
nl|kind aan een vervormd hart en zou hij een bloedziekte hebben Hij was tot zijn 
nl|vijftiende levensjaar bedlegerig Op april onderging hij zijn bekeringservaring Hij is in een tijdsbestek van 
nl|tien minuten driemaal gestorven uit zijn lichaam getreden en zag iedere keer de poort van 
nl|de hel maar kwam steeds weer tot leven De derde keer vroeg hij om vergeving 
nl|van zijn zonden Hagin claimt ook dat hij in door een openbaring van God opstond 
nl|van het sterfbed Twee jaar later hield hij zijn eerste preek in een kleine kerk 
nl|bij hem in de buurt In de twaalf jaar die daarop volgde zou hij in

nl|dan zal het ook gebeuren” Critici van Hagin onder wie een groot aantal christenen afkomstig 
nl|uit de charismatische beweging zien zijn uitspraken als sektarisch en niet in overeenstemming met de 
nl|leer van de christelijke In brachten twee studenten van de Oral Roberts University aan het 
nl|licht dat Hagin veel van zijn theologie letterlijk heeft overgenomen uit de boeken van andere 
nl|auteurs Zo kwam aan het licht dat Hagin plagiaat had gepleegd door woord voor woord 
nl|teksten te kopiëren uit de boeken van de evangelist E W Kenyon Hagin verwierp de 
nl|aantijgingen met het argument dat het niet zo gek was dat hij letterlijk dingen zou

nl|gewervelde dieren In de brede zin van het woord omvat het alle dierlijke en soms 
nl|menselijke weefsels inclusief organen zoals lever of nieren In de engste zin slaat de term 
nl|uitsluitend op het spierweefsel van zoogdieren die gekweekt zijn voor consumptie door de mens Het 
nl|merendeel van het vlees dat geconsumeerd wordt is afkomstig van dieren uit de bioindustrie slachtvlees 
nl|Eén van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van vlees is kweekvlees In de kookkunst 
nl|en in wetenschappelijk onderzoek voor wat betreft de gezondheidseffecten van vlees wordt vlees regelmatig ingedeeld 
nl|in vier De kleur van vlees wordt deels bepaald door de oxidatietoestand van het ijzeratoom 
nl|in myoglobine en de zuurstofatomen die eraan verbonden zijn Wanneer vlees nog in de rauwe 
nl|toestand is is het ijzeratoom in de oxidatietoestand en gebonden aan dizuurstof daardoor ontstaat roodachtig 
nl|oxymyoglobine waardoor myoglobinerijk vlees er rood uitziet Vlees dat gaargekookt is neemt een grauwe tot 
nl|grauwbruine kleur aan door de vorming van metmyoglobine dat bij verhitting ontstaat denaturatie Daarbij bevindt 
nl|het ijzeratoom zich nu in de oxidatietoestand het heeft een elektron verloren en heeft nu 
nl|een watermolecule bij zich Onder bepaalde omstandigheden kan vlees roze blijven gedurende verhitting hoewel het 
nl|aan hoge temperaturen wordt blootgesteld Wanneer rauw vlees aan nitriet wordt blootgesteld zal het vlees 
nl|roze blijven omdat het ijzeratoom dan gebonden is aan NO stikstofmonoxide Onder meer cornedbeef en 
nl|de meeste ham worden behandeld met kaliumnitriet of natriumnitriet Bij vleeswaren die verpakt worden in 
nl|een atmosfeer met koolmonoxide bindt het ijzermolecule aan koolmonoxide waardoor metmyoglobine wordt gevormd Het oppervlak 
nl|van deze vleeswaren blijft dan roze wat in de ogen van de consument met "vers" 
nl|wordt geassocieerd Deze kunstmatig veroorzaakte rode kleur kan echter zeer lang in het vlees aanwezig 
nl|blijven tot wel een jaar De hoeveelheid en typen spiervezels kunnen tussen verschillende dieren uiteenlopen 
nl|Daardoor is de roodheid van vlees sterk afhankelijk van diersoort leeftijd van het dier en 
nl|de hoeveelheid beweging die het dier heeft gehad De Nederlandse huishoudens consumeren jaarlijks miljoen kilo 
nl|varkensvlees voor een waarde van miljoen euro Per hoofd van de bevolking werd in vlees 
nl|per jaar gebruikt rund kalf varken kip kalkoen Omdat in dat gemiddelde ook vegetariërs en

nl|hoofd van de bevolking Méér dan driekwart van het in Nederland geproduceerde vlees wordt geëxporteerd 
nl|In werd voor bijna miljard gulden aan vlees en vleesproducten en voor miljard gulden aan 
nl|zuivelproducten Tegelijk werd in voor miljard gulden aan veehouderijproducten geïmporteerd Er zijn anno tegengestelde tendensen 
nl|waar te nemen in de prijsstelling van vlees Aan de ene kant proberen Nederlandse supermarkten 
nl|klanten te lokken met goedkoop vlees kip eurokg en aan de andere kant verkopen sommige 
nl|supermarkten biologisch vlees kip eurokg dat ruim een factor duurder is De prijzen van eieren 
nl|variëren van tot euro per stuk dat is een factor prijsverschil Rond nam de vleesconsumptie

nl|bevatten volgens de onderzoekers het doorslaggevende bewijs dat rood en verwerkt vlees in grotere hoeveelheden 
nl|gevaarlijk kan zijn Om deze reden beveelt het WCRF aan dat mensen niet meer dan 
nl|rood vlees gegaard gewicht dit staat gelijk aan rauw per week eten en verwerkt vlees

nl|heemijzer Rood vlees wordt daarnaast ook in verband gebracht met een hoger totaal overlijdensrisico en 
nl|een hoger risico om te sterven aan hart en Wit vlees zoals dat van gevogelte 
nl|wordt daarentegen juist in verband gebracht met een lager totaal overlijdensrisico en een kleinere kans 
nl|om aan hart en vaatziekten of kanker te In een grootschalig epidemiologisch onderzoek bleek de 
nl|consumptie van verwerkt vlees ook geassocieerd met een verhoogd risico op beroerte bij Eerder bleek 
nl|een dergelijk verband ook al bij Echter in een grote studie de EPIC studie onder 
nl|meer dan mensen geschikt voor analyse in Europa waar aan ook het Nederlandse RIVM heeft 
nl|meegewerkt bleek er in eerste instantie een verhoogd risico te zijn op het totaal overlijdensrisico 
nl|bij rood vlees gebruikers maar bleef dit na correctie voor bewerkt vlees en meetfouten niet 
nl|meer overeind Uiteindelijk bleek alleen de relatie tussen het totale overlijdensrisico en bewerkt vlees significant 
nl|Het ging hier om een hazardratio van per gramdag bij een mediane followup duur van 
nl|jaar De onderzoekers schatten dat van de sterfte voorkomen kan worden als alle deelnemers aan 
nl|de studie minder dan gram bewerkt vlees per dag zouden Het ging dan vooral om 
nl|sterfte door hart en vaatziekten en in mindere mate om kanker Opvallend was dat de 
nl|totale sterfte hoger was bij de mensen die weinig tot geen rood vlees consumeerden Ook 
nl|hier werd geen verband gevonden tussen de consumptie van gevogelte en de totale sterfte De 
nl|consumptie van vlees wordt sterk bepaald door de cultuur Afhankelijk daarvan worden sommige dieren niet

nl|Iljitsj Tsjaikovski geschreven in en Het concert bestaat uit drie delen In beleefde Tsjaikovski's eerste 
nl|pianoconcert een enorme populariteit Nikolaj Rubinstein had bij dit werk een aantal verbeteringen aangegeven na 
nl|het werk te hebben bestudeerd en een aantal keren te hebben voorgedragen Vooral de voordrachten 
nl|droegen bij aan de populariteit Tsjaikovski voelde zich door de immense populariteit van zijn pianoconcert 
nl|in bes mineur genoodzaakt een nieuw pianoconcert te schrijven Hij begon hiermee in oktober toen 
nl|hij verbleef bij zijn zuster te Kamenka Hier schreef hij zijn patrones en hartsvriendin Nadjezda 
nl|von Meck; Ik wil dit concert opdragen aan NG Rubinstein ter waardering voor zijn magnifieke 
nl|spel in het eerste pianoconcert en mijn sonate Hij liet mij in absolute vervoering nadat 
nl|hij het voor mij speelde in Moskou Het componeren ging Tsjaikovski vlug af Maart voltooide 
nl|hij het werk en bracht de orkestratie aan Tsjaikovski zat echter nog met Rubinsteins reactie 
nl|op het werk Hij schreef Von Meck; Ik huiver van de gedachte dat ik misschien 
nl|weer kritiek van Nikolaj Grigorjevitsj aan wie ik dit concert heb opgedragen krijg Desalniettemin zelfs 
nl|als hij het concert bekritiseert maar het dan wel zo briljant opvoert als het eerste 
nl|concert zal die kritiek mij niet uitmaken Ondertussen ben ik zelf erg tevreden met het 
nl|concert maar wat in de toekomst ligt dat kan ik niet zeggen Tsjaikovski had zich 
nl|nergens zorgen over moeten maken Rubinsteins reactie was deze keer voorzichtig Hij suggereerde dat het 
nl|sologedeelte té episodisch was té veel verwikkeld in een dialoog met het orkest dan aanwezig 
nl|op de voorgrond Hier voegde hij aan toe; nu ik dit alles zeg nauwelijks nog 
nl|wat van het concert te hebben gespeeld zit ik misschien verkeerd Tsjaikovski deed Rubinsteins commentaar 
nl|van de hand overigens zonder enige rancune In maart overleed Rubinstein Tsjaikovski vluchtte naar Parijs 
nl|om zijn begrafenis bij te wonen Het concert beleefde zijn première op november te New 
nl|York met het New York Philharmonic en Madeline Schiller als soliste In mei werd de 
nl|Russische première gehouden te Moskou Anton Rubinstein dirigeerde met Tsjaikovski's leerling Sergej Tanejev als solist 
nl|Het tweede pianoconcert werd in tegenstelling tot zijn voorganger goed door het publiek opgenomen Critici 
nl|vielen echter over een paar kleinigheden; het Allegro brillante e molto vivace en het Andante 
nl|non troppo waren té lang en het hoofdthema was té verwarrend en bevatte te veel 
nl|solistische cadensen De pianist Aleksander Ziloti bewerkte om deze twee aanmerkingen het concert lichtelijk Hij 
nl|verkortte het eerste deel met maten en het tweede deel met maten Meer verbaasd werd 
nl|gereageerd op het feit dat in het Andante non troppo een grote solistische rol was 
nl|weggelegd voor de viool en de cello De piano zou uit zijn functie zijn getreden 
nl|door deze twee solisten te veel te begeleiden Het concert begint met een trots thema 
nl|voor het orkest dat met grootse akkoorden door de piano wordt overgenomen Een warm tweede 
nl|thema door de klarinet ingezet wordt overgenomen door de piano Een korte cadenza wordt ingezet 
nl|waarna een grootse cadenza wordt ingezet Deze wordt weer overgenomen door het hoofdthema Een herhaling 
nl|uitgevoerd door het orkest volgt waarbij een briljant coda het Allegro brillante e molto vivace 
nl|afsluit Het Andante non troppo opent met een vier minuten durende solo voor de viool 
nl|en cello De lieflijke melodie wordt overgenomen door de piano na de vier minuten De 
nl|sfeer straalt schoonheid en sereniteit uit Spanning ontwikkelt zich in het midden met een lange 
nl|passage voor het orkest De cello en viool keren terug waarna hetzij nu de piano 
nl|begeleidend Het Allegro con fuoco opent met de piano die een uitbundig thema speelt De

nl|EPrime Bourland afkorting voor English Prime heeft oorspronkelijk betrekking op een modificatie van de Engelse 
nl|taal die het gebruik van alle vormen van het werkwoord “zijn” verbiedt maar is evenzeer 
nl|van toepassing op vrijwel elke andere taal dus ook het Nederlands D David Bourland Jr 
nl|stelde een aantal jaren na de dood van Korzybski in EPrime voor als toevoeging aan 
nl|Afred Korzybski's algemene semantiek Bourland die bij Korzybski studeerde bedacht de term in een essay 
nl|uit met de titel A Linguistic Note Writing in EPrime oorspronkelijk gepubliceerd in het General 
nl|Semantics Bulletin Het riep al snel een controverse op binnen de algemene semantiek deels omdat 
nl|beoefenaars van de Algemene Semantiek vonden dat Bourland het werkwoord ‘zijn’ als zodanig aanviel en 
nl|niet bepaalde manieren waarop het gebruikt werd Korzybski had gezien dat de twee vormen van 
nl|het werkwoord ‘zijn’— het 'is' van identiteit en het bewerende ‘is' — structurele problemen opleverden 
nl|Bijvoorbeeld de zin “De jas is rood” heeft geen waarnemer de zin “We zien de 
nl|jas als rood” waar “we” de waarnemers aangeeft lijkt juister dan de feiten over lichtgolven 
nl|en kleur zoals ze door de moderne wetenschap weergegeven worden dat wil zeggen dat kleur 
nl|het resultaat is van een reactie in het menselijk brein Korzybski bepleitte het verhogen van 
nl|iemands bewustzijn doorgaans door het trainen in algemene semantiek In het gebruik heeft het werkwoord 
nl|‘zijn’ duidelijk verschillende functies Bourland ziet met name de functies van “identiteit” en “bewering” als 
nl|verderfelijk maar bepleit het elimineren van alle vormen ten bate van de eenvoud In het 
nl|geval van de “bestaans”vorm en minder idiomatisch de “plaats”vorm kan men het eenvoudig vervangen door 
nl|“bestaat” EPrime dwingt de schrijver werkwoorden en betekenissen zorgvuldig te kiezen het elimineren van “zijn” 
nl|elimineert impliciet de passieve stem en het progressieve aspect Alleen al deze beperking is verantwoordelijk 
nl|voor een groot deel van de aantrekkingskracht van EPrime voor sommigen van de pleitbezorgers ervan 
nl|aangezien vele stilisten betogen dat zulke constructies maar al te vaak in slordig geschreven Engels 
nl|voorkomen Natuurlijk kan het voor sommige schrijvers ook problemen opleveren als ze EPrime leren gebruiken 
nl|Bourland en andere pleitbezorgers opperen ook dat het gebruik van EPrime tot een minder dogmatische 
nl|taalstijl leidt en dat de mogelijkheid tot misverstand en conflict kleiner wordt Zie bijvoorbeeld hieronder 
nl|bij Links het artikel van Bourland over grondslagen van EPrime Kwaadsprekers zouden kunnen opmerken dat 
nl|sommige talen equivalenten van het werkwoord “zijn” nu al heel verschillend hanteren zonder dat ze 
nl|de sprekers duidelijke voordelen bieden Het Arabisch mist net als het Russisch bijvoorbeeld al een 
nl|werkwoordsvorm van “zijn” in de tegenwoordige tijd Als iemand in het Arabisch wil beweren dat 
nl|een appel er rood uitziet zal hij niet letterlijk zeggen “de appel is rood” maar 
nl|“de appel roodt” Sprekers kunnen met andere woorden zelfs zonder het bestaan van het woord 
nl|zelf toch de werkwoordsvorm van “zijn” communiceren met de semantische voor en nadelen daarvan Voor 
nl|hen biedt de poging tot het afzwakken van de dubbelzinnigheden door Eprime dus geen oplossing 
nl|Op dezelfde manier maakt de taal van de Ainu consequent geen onderscheid tussen “zijn” en 
nl|“worden”; dus ne betekent voor hen zowel “zijn” als “worden” en pirka betekent zowel “goed” 
nl|“wees goed” als “wordt goed” Veel talen — bijvoorbeeld Japans Spaans en Hebreeuws — maken 
nl|al het onderscheid tussen “bestaanplaats” en “identiteitbewering” EPrime en Charles Kay Ogdens Basic English zijn 
nl|niet met elkaar verenigbaar omdat Basic English een gesloten verzameling werkwoorden heeft die werkwoorden zoals 
nl|“worden” “blijven” en “gelijk” uitsluiten die EPrime gebruikt om op een nauwkeurige manier toestanden van 
nl|het zijn te beschrijven Wijzigingen zoals die voor EPrime zijn voorgesteld zouden ook zoveel manieren 
nl|elimineren om het aspect in het AfroAmerikaanse moederEngels uit te drukken dat het onwerkbaar zou 
nl|blijken te zijn als het in het wilde weg in zo’n taal toegepast zou worden 
nl|Alfred Korzybski heeft kritiek uitgeoefend op het gebruik van het werkwoord “zijn” en van hem 
nl|wordt de uitspraak aangehaald dat “elke stelling die het woord ‘is’ bevat of het daaraan 
nl|verwante ‘zijn’ ‘was’ enz een linguïstische structuur creëert die uiteindelijk ernstige misvattingen oplevert” Maar hij 
nl|zei ook dat de door hem bedachte uitspraak “de kaart is niet het gebied” gerechtvaardigd 
nl|was omdat “de ontkenning van de identificatie zoals in ‘is niet’ tegenovergestelde neurolinguistische effecten op 
nl|de hersenen heeft vergeleken met de uitspraak over identiteit zoals in ‘is’ Noam Chomsky algemeen 
nl|beschouwd als de vader van de huidige taalwetenschappen heeft commentaar geleverd op de kritiek van 
nl|Korzybski waarbij hij aanvoert dat het lijkt dat Korzybski van gedachten is veranderd Chomsky zei 
nl|“Soms kan iets wat we zeggen misleidend zijn soms niet afhankelijk van of we al 
nl|dan niet zorgvuldig zijn Misschien staat er wel meer in Korzybski’s werk maar ik zie 
nl|het niet Dat was de conclusie van mijn scriptie jaar geleden Toen ik Korbzyski zorgvuldig 
nl|doorlas kon ik niets anders ontdekken dan dat niet óf onbelangrijk óf onjuist was Wat 
nl|betreft de neurolingistische effecten op de hersenen daar was niets over bekend toen hij zijn 
nl|werk schreef en heel weinig dat tegenwoordig relevant is” Chomsky een anarchist heeft ook gezegd 
nl|dat de grootste verstoorders van onze waarneming machtsconcentraties zijn zoals staten en bedrijven Hij gelooft 
nl|dat machtscentra over veel meer middelen beschikken om hun eigen standpunten te verspreiden en onze 
nl|waarneming van de werkelijkheid te beïnvloeden dan gewoon alleen het werkwoord “zijn” niet te gebruiken 
nl|Zijn valt in het Nederlands onder de groep onregelmatige werkwoorden EPrime zou dus de volgende 
nl|woorden verhinderen omdat het vormen van zijn zijn De volgende woorden zijn in EPrime wel 
nl|toegestaan omdat ze niet afgeleid zijn van zijn Een aantal daarvan dienen voor dezelfde grammaticale 
nl|functies De volgende woorden worden hetzelfde geschreven homograaf of klinken als homofoon vormen van het 
nl|werkwoord zijn maar hebben niet dezelfde betekenis Deze voorbeelden geven een aantal manieren aan waarop 
nl|het Standaardnederlands veranderd kan worden door gebruik te maken van EPrime Viooltjes lijken blauw Ik 
nl|vind honing lekker En vind dat ook van jou Viooltjes zijn blauw Honing is lekker 
nl|Zo is het ook met jou In het oorspronkelijke gedicht Rozen zijn rood; Viooltjes zijn 
nl|blauw Honing is lekker Zo is het ook met jou drukt de spreker zijn geloof 
nl|in absolute waarden uit “zoals het waar is dat rozen rood en honing zoet is 
nl|is het waar dat jij zo zoet als honing bent” Met andere woorden de spreker 
nl|vindt iets en spreekt die persoonlijke mening uit als waarheid Het is niet absoluut waar 
nl|maar het is de subjectieve waarheid van de spreker Dat is waar Als iemand zijn 
nl|persoonlijke mening geeft en daarbij een van de vormen van zijn gebruikt maakt hij zich 
nl|schuldig aan een denkfout De werkelijkheid is en alles wat mensen over de werkelijkheid zeggen 
nl|is niet maar is hun mening Een mening is geen eigenschap van de werkelijkheid maar 
nl|een eigenschap van de spreker Zijn behoort dus uitsluitend tot het bestaande het zijnde Wat 
nl|iemand beweert over het zijnde zegt dus primair iets over het subjectieve filter waarmee hij 
nl|de werkelijkheid bekijkt Lekker is geen eigenschap van voedsel maar een mening van de eter 
nl|zoals het rood zijn geen eigenschap van de roos maar een afspraak is Dus wij 
nl|noemen een roos rood en zeggen vervolgens ten onrechte dat de roos rood is Wij 
nl|hebben de afspraak gemaakt dat wij de optelling + vier noemen maar + is geen 
nl|vier EPrime probeert dit soort denken en schrijven te vermijden door te wijzen op een 
nl|duidelijk onderscheid tussen meningen opvattingen geloven en overtuigingen en feitelijkheden Dingen zijn niet normaal lekker 
nl|mooi belangrijk en leuk maar mensen vinden ze normaal lekker mooi belangrijk en leuk Een 
nl|EPrimevertaling waarin geprobeerd wordt om de letterlijke betekenis van het origineel te bewaren zou als 
nl|volgt kunnen luiden Rozen zien er rood uit; Viooltjes zien er blauw uit Honing bevalt 
nl|mij En jij ook Het volgende voorbeeld offert de metafoor op die regel van het 
nl|origineel inhoudt “jij bent honingzoet” om de letterlijke betekenis van regel te handhaven namelijk dat 
nl|honing zoet smaakt en daardoor regel vervangt door een vergelijkbare betekenis die dicht bij het 
nl|origineel ligt “honing smaakt zoet en iets in jou zorgt ervoor dat jij net zo 
nl|zoet bent” Rozen zien er rood uit; Viooltjes zien er blauw uit Honing smaakt lekker 
nl|Even lekker als jij Dit voorbeeld gaat ervan uit dat de spreker niet bedoelt dat 
nl|de aangesprokene van het gedicht “zoet smaakt” maar hij bedoelt zoiets als “ik vind jou 
nl|net zo zoet als honing” waarbij hij probeert metrum en ritme van het origineel te 
nl|bewaren terwijl hij toch elke vorm van het werkwoord “zijn” probeert te vermijden Om uit 
nl|het origineel de aanname te verwijderen van iets absoluuts “wat is” en denken en standpunt 
nl|meer weer te geven in de geest van EPrime is de volgende vertaling een poging 
nl|om de bedoeling van een hypothetische spreker ten opzichte van de aangesprokene rechtstreeks te beschrijven 
nl|en die bedoeling te laten zien via het filter van de opvattingen van de spreker 
nl|over de werkelijkheid Onderstaande vertaling verandert dus de bedoeling van het gedicht Rozen noemen wij 
nl|rood; Viooltjes noemen wij blauw Ik hou van honing en ik hou van jou Die 
nl|versie is dus een poging om iets te zeggen dat sterk lijkt op “Ik neem 
nl|de werkelijkheid waar op de manier waarop de meeste mensen dat doen Er zijn maar 
nl|weinig mensen die zouden willen betwisten dat de meest voorkomende rozensoort voor het menselijke oog 
nl|rood lijkt of dat viooltjes er blauw uit kunnen zien Als ik je dus vertel 
nl|dat ik van honing hou en van jou beweer ik dat ik die uitspraak doe

nl|die op verschillende plaatsen in Europa opdrachten uitvoerde Zijn bekendste werk is de driekoningenschrijn dat 
nl|zich in de dom van Keulen bevindt en die de relikwieën van de Drie Koningen 
nl|bevat en het grootste edelsmeedwerk uit de middeleeuwen is Over het leven van Nicolaas van 
nl|Verdun is niets bekend; zijn naam is ons slechts bekend doordat hij twee van zijn 
nl|drie bekende werken signeerde en dateerde Het eerste werk is de ambo van de kerk 
nl|van het Benedictijnerklooster van Klosterneuburg bij Wenen Dit werk kwam volgens de inscriptie gereed in 
nl|en was het werk van "Nicolaus Verdunensis" Een dergelijk grote opdracht het is het omvangrijkste 
nl|emailwerk uit de twaalfde eeuw werd ongetwijfeld niet toevertrouwd aan een beginnende edelsmid en het 
nl|is dan ook aannemelijk dat Nicolaas al een groot meester was toen hij naar Klosterneuburg 
nl|gehaald werd De ambo is ons overgeleverd als een altaarstuk in triptiekvorm van hoog Nadat 
nl|in de ambo beschadigd werd door brand is het werk namelijk omgevormd en werden de 
nl|zijkanten van de ambo ingezet als de luiken van het triptiek Het werk bestaat uit 
nl|scènes in email waarvan er origineel van Nicolaas zijn die zijn gegroepeerd in drie rijen 
nl|Elke emaillen voorstelling wordt omzoomd door een driepasboog van verguld brons Deze drie rijen voorstellingen 
nl|hebben elk hun eigen onderwerp de centrale rij bestaat uit nieuwtestamentische episodes De bovenste en 
nl|onderste rijen bevatten scènes uit het Oude Testament respectievelijk voor en na het opleggen van 
nl|de tien geboden Verticaal komt er hierbij een gecompliceerd typologisch programma tot stand Zo wordt 
nl|de engel van de annunciatie geflankeerd door de engelen die de geboortes van Isaak en 
nl|Samson aankondigden Aan de schrijn voor de relieken van de Heilige Drie Koningen werd door 
nl|Nicolaas en zijn atelier tussen en gewerkt Met zijn lengte van breedte van en hoogte 
nl|van is dit de grootste middeleeuwse reliekschrijn Bovendien is het door zijn versiering met meer 
nl|dan edelstenen en parels en antieke gemmen en cameeën en het gebruik van edelmetalen waarschijnlijk 
nl|ook de kostbaarste Deze reliekhouder is het andere gedocumenteerde werk van Nicolaas van Verdun en 
nl|waarschijnlijk het laatste werk van de meester Het dateert van en werd door Nicolaas gesigneerd 
nl|met "Hoc opus fecit magister Nicolaus de Verdun" dit werk is gemaakt door meester Nicolaus 
nl|van Verdun De schrijn meet bij en is gemaakt van verguld zilver en brons rond 
nl|een houten kern en bezet met edelstenen parels en email De schrijn in de vorm 
nl|van een huis met schilddak werd gemaakt voor de kathedraal van Doornik voor de relieken 
nl|van OnzeLieveVrouw die deze kerk bezat Deze relieken werden in de elfde eeuw in processie 
nl|door de stad gedragen om een pestepidemie af te zweren Nog altijd wordt de schrijn 
nl|tijdens een jaarlijkse processie rond De schrijn werd waarschijnlijk tijdens de beeldenstorm van zijn relieken 
nl|beroofd Rondom is de relikwieënschrijn voorzien van een arcade met driepasbogen op dubbele zuilen en 
nl|in het dak zijn medaillons aangebracht met voorstellingen Het meeste van deze gegoten beeldjes zijn 
nl|niet meer origineel van de hand van Nicolaas maar het resultaat van laatmiddeleeuwse of negentiendeeeuwse 
nl|herstelwerkzaamheden De hand van Nicolaas is echter wel te vinden in de beeldjes die zich 
nl|rondom de schrijn in de arcades bevinden Aan het hoofd bevindt zich Christus op een 
nl|troon geflankeerd door engelen met Passiewerktuigen aan de andere zijde bevindt zich de aanbidding van 
nl|de drie koningen Aan de lange zijde bevinden zich aan de ene kant voorstellingen van 
nl|de vlucht naar Egypte de presentatie in de tempel en de doop De andere lange 
nl|zijde is getooid met voorstellingen van annunciatie visitatie en de geboorte van Jezus De schrijn 
nl|is een van de zeven wonderen van België Het werk van Nicolaas van Verdun bevindt 
nl|zich stilistisch op de overgang tussen Romaans en Gotisch en wordt beschouwd als het hoogtepunt

nl|met zijn neef Piet Veerman het duo The Everly Kosters toen hij door Arnold Mühren 
nl|en Cees Veerman werd gevraagd zich aan te sluiten bij Electric Johnny The Skyriders Hij 
nl|ging akkoord wanneer ook de andere helft van The Everly Kosters Piet Veerman mee zou 
nl|komen wat ook gebeurde Op een gegeven moment splitste het viertal zich af en gingen 
nl|ze door als de Mystic Four Hun naam wijzigden ze later in The Blue Cats 
nl|en vervolgens in The Cats terwijl ondertussen Theo Klouwer zich als nieuwe drummer bij hen 
nl|aansloot Voor The Cats speelde hij voornamelijk gitaar en zette hij akkoorden onder veel nummers 
nl|Verder had hij een hoog stemgeluid in de achtergrondzang van veel songs Hij is met 
nl|een paar maanden verschil de oudste muzikant van The Cats en wordt daarom ook wel 
nl|de 'oudste rocker van Volendam' genoemd In de autobiografie The Story Of noemde Piet Veerman 
nl|hem ook wel 'De belangrijkste Cat' Medio jaren zeventig kondigden ze aan te stoppen en 
nl|ook Schilder kwam in deze tijd met een soloalbum die in verhouding tot de platenverkopen 
nl|van de band weinig succesvol waren Daarna kwamen ze weer bij elkaar en brachten ze 
nl|de single uit met de toepasselijke titel We should be together In die tijd speelde 
nl|hij ook mee op een elpee Rhythm And Booze van GT Walls in feite een

nl|formatie Streetbeats van Jan Toen The Cats in opnieuw uit elkaar lagen kwam hij nogmaals 
nl|met een elpee Absence makes the heart grow fonder als Jay Coster samen met Tanya 
nl|Anja van Scherpenseel De nummers werden geleverd door Golsteijn Na het einde van The Cats 
nl|was hij metselaar en gaf hij daarnaast gitaarles In de jaren negentig vormde hij met

nl|en Arnold Mühren opgenomen in de Orde van Oranje Nassau Naast de volgende albums speelde 
nl|hij mee op het soloalbum van Cees Veerman uit Another side of me Schilder schreef 
nl|zesentwintig nummers alleen en samen met anderen die The Cats op elpee en single uitbrachten 
nl|waaronder samen met Piet Veerman het nummer Let's go together dat als single werd uitgebracht 
nl|en op nummer terechtkwam van de Top Met Karel Hille schreef hij een van de

nl|wordt gefixeerd in een zoutoplossing en daarna afgespoeld met water Deze beelden waren destijds gedetailleerder 
nl|dan de eerdere procedures Doordat er geen negatief wordt gebruikt is het niet mogelijk om 
nl|meerdere afdrukken te maken Elke daguerreotypie is daardoor uniek Daguerre maakte rond de eerste goede 
nl|scherpe foto Vanwege de hoge ontwikkelingskosten moest Daguerre zijn kostbare patenten duur verkopen en ook 
nl|door de ingewikkelde apparatuur was fotografie aanvankelijk alleen mogelijk voor welgestelden In de jaren verdween

nl|letterkundige Hij was hoogleraar in Göttingen en Berlijn en verrichtte baanbrekend werk op het gebied 
nl|van de lexicografie de vergelijkende taalkunde en de mythologie Jacob Grimm werkte vaak samen met 
nl|zijn jongere broer Wilhelm Grimm Samen staan ze bekend als de gebroeders Grimm Grimm werd 
nl|geboren in Hanau in het Landgraafschap HessenKassel Zijn vader die jurist was stierf toen Jacob 
nl|nog een kind was Daardoor bleven hij zijn moeder zijn jongere broer Wilhelm en zijn 
nl|jongere zus Lotte alleen achter Vanaf bezochten Jacob en Wilhelm de openbare school in Kassel 
nl|In ging Grimm naar de Universiteit van Marburg waar hij rechten studeerde Zijn broer voegde 
nl|zich een jaar later bij hem in Marburg nadat hij net hersteld was van een 
nl|langdurige en ernstige ziekte Ook Wilhelm ging rechten studeren Op de universiteit volgde hij colleges 
nl|bij de rechtsgeleerde Friedrich Carl von Savigny Door diens rechtshistorische onderzoek werd Grimms interesse in 
nl|de geschiedenis van de Duitse taal en literatuur gewekt De twee mannen konden het ook 
nl|persoonlijk goed met elkaar vinden Toen Savigny in voor wetenschappelijk werk naar Parijs reisde liet 
nl|hij Grimm al snel nakomen om met literair werk te helpen Al snel werd Grimm 
nl|moe van de rechtenstudie en in brieven gaf hij aan dat hij zich liever met 
nl|oudDuitse literatuur bezig wilde houden Eind reisde hij zonder zijn studie afgemaakt te hebben terug 
nl|naar Kassel waar zijn moeder en broer waren gaan wonen Het jaar erop kreeg hij 
nl|een baantje bij het Hessische oorlogsministerie maar nam al binnen een jaar ontslag In kort 
nl|na de dood van zijn moeder werd Grimm benoemd tot hoofd van de privébibliotheek van 
nl|Jérôme Bonaparte die na de bezetting door Napoleon Bonaparte in koning van Westfalen was geworden 
nl|Bovendien werd hij door de koning tot lid van de staatsraad benoemd In deze hoedanigheid 
nl|had hij weinig officiële taken en dus konden hij en zijn broer de bibliotheek voor 
nl|hun eigen onderzoek gebruiken Onder andere verzamelden ze in deze tijd sprookjes waarvan het eerste 
nl|deel in werd gepubliceerd In werd het Koninkrijk Westfalen na de nederlaag van Napoleon opgeheven 
nl|en het Keurvorstendom Hessen weer hersteld Wegens Grimms goede kennis van het Frans werd hij 
nl|in de diplomatieke dienst van het keurvorstendom opgenomen Hij onderhandelde in Parijs over de teruggave 
nl|van door Fransen uit Hessen geroofde kunstschatten en in was hij secretaris van de delegatie 
nl|op het Congres van Wenen Zijn verblijf in Wenen gebruikte hij ook om in de 
nl|Weense bibliotheek oude handschriften te onderzoeken In verliet Grimm de diplomatieke dienst Wilhelm Grimm was 
nl|inmiddels in dienst van de bibliotheek van Kassel en in werd Jacob Grimm daar tweede 
nl|bibliothecaris In stierf de eerste bibliothecaris Toen Jacob en Wilhelm Grimm tegen hun verwachting in 
nl|niet tot eerste en tweede bibliothecaris bevorderd werden begonnen ze ontevreden naar een andere betrekking 
nl|om te zien In verhuisden de gebroeders Grimm naar Göttingen dat in het Koninkrijk Hannover 
nl|lag Jakob Grimm werd er hoogleraar in de Duitse taal en literatuur en juristisch bibliothecaris 
nl|aan de universiteit; zijn broer werd onderbibliothecaris Toen de gebroeders Grimm in als leden van 
nl|de Göttinger Sieben tegen de afschaffing van de liberale grondwet protesteerden werden ze ontslagen en 
nl|uit het land verbannen De broers keerden terug naar Kassel In werden de gebroeders Grimm 
nl|door de Pruisische koning Frederik Willem IV uitgenodigd om in Berlijn hoogleraar te worden en 
nl|lid te worden van de Pruisische Academie van Wetenschappen Jacob Grimm hoefde niet vaak te 
nl|onderwijzen en deed dat dan ook zelden In stierf Jacob Grimm op leeftijd in Berlijn 
nl|aan de gevolgen van een beroerte Jacob en Wilhelm Grimm tekenden veel – vooral Duitse 
nl|– volkssprookjes en sagen op die ze tussen en als schrijversnavertellers publiceerden onder de titel 
nl|Kinder und Hausmärchen Jacob Grimm formuleerde in in zijn Deutsche Grammatik de wetmatigheid die in 
nl|de historische taalkunde de eerste Germaanse klankverschuiving beschrijft Hoewel hij niet de eerste was die 
nl|deze klankwet beschreef staat hij algemeen bekend als de wet van Grimm Het laatste grote 
nl|project van de gebroeders Grimm was het Deutsches Wörterbuch een groot beschrijvend woordenboek van het 
nl|Duits waaraan beiden vanaf werkten Het eerste deel verscheen in maar de afronding van het 
nl|project hebben ze niet meer meegemaakt het laatste deel werd voltooid in Jacob Grimm was 
nl|ook actief op het terrein van de rechtsgeschiedenis Hij publiceerde in een collectie Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer 
nl|Later begon hij met de uitgave van een omvangrijke verzameling zogeheten wijsdommen onder de titel 
nl|Deutsche Weisthümer delen Göttingen Grimm meende dat hij hierin het oeroude gewoonterecht van het Duitse 
nl|Rijk had vastgelegd Deze visie heeft lang standgehouden maar tegenwoordig veronderstelt men dat in deze 
nl|teksten een veel jongere rechtssituatie is vastgelegd In dat boek beschrijft hij het Lohnse hofrecht

nl|weggelaten men zegt en schrijft 'GilzeRijen' Dit is wél de naam van het station aan 
nl|de zuidzijde van Rijen aan de Spoorlijn Breda Eindhoven en de in het centrum van 
nl|de gemeente liggende vliegbasis GilzeRijen Gilze en Rijen liggen hemelsbreed vier kilometer uit elkaar maar 
nl|over de weg via Hulten is het kilometer omdat de Molenschotse Heide en vliegbasis GilzeRijen 
nl|en de ertussenin liggen Vóór de vestiging van de vliegbasis was dit niet het geval 
nl|en liep er een nagenoeg rechte weg naar Gilze over de Nerhovensche Heide Het bedevaartsplaatsje 
nl|Molenschot ligt westelijk het verst van Tilburg Gilze en Hulten dat in de oorlog grotendeels 
nl|verwoest werd liggen sinds de laatste uitbreiding van de Reeshof dichter bij het Tilburgse woongebied 
nl|dan bij Rijen of Molenschot Het mediaconcern Audax en de vliegbasis zijn grote werkgevers; verder 
nl|bieden Tilburg Breda en Oosterhout werkgelegenheid Bij Molenschot zijn jaar oude bewoningsresten van de Tjongercultuur 
nl|gevonden maar van de andere kernen is uit prehistorische tijden weinig bekend De naam Gilze 
nl|duikt voor het eerst op in een schenkingsakte van Hilsondis gravin van Strijen aan de 
nl|Abdis van Thorn Hoewel de echtheid van de akte wordt betwist moet de schenking voor 
nl|het begin van de eeuw hebben plaatsgehad Hierdoor is Gilze een van de oudste plaatsen 
nl|in de Baronie van Breda De Abdis hield tot aan de Franse Revolutie belangrijke rechten 
nl|en bezittingen op Gilze ondanks het feit dat het gebied inmiddels in bezit was van 
nl|de Heer van Breda De Heer van Breda stelde in de eeuw de Schepenbank van 
nl|Gilze in Deze was samengesteld uit een door die Heer benoemde schout en zeven schepenen 
nl|Zij waren zowel bestuurders als rechters in civiele zaken De boet en lijfstraffelijke rechtspraak was 
nl|voorbehouden aan de schepenbank van de stad Breda Naast de schepenbank bestond er nog een 
nl|college van negen gezworenen Zij mochten hun stem uitbrengen en gehoord worden over financiële zaken 
nl|De schepenbank van de Abdis van Thorn samengesteld uit een meier en zeven schepenen was 
nl|een cijns of laatgerecht Tot hun bevoegdheid behoorde de certificatie van eigendomsovergang en eigendomsbezwaringen onder 
nl|het rechtsgebied van de abdis Van de schepenen waren er steeds drie afkomstig uit Gilze 
nl|twee uit Oosterhout één uit Ginneken en één uit Princenhage of Rijsbergen Rijen was een 
nl|buurtschap van Gilze Hierin kwam verandering toen dit dorp in een kapel kreeg en in 
nl|verheven werd tot zelfstandige parochie Het is ook vanaf dit moment dat de dubbele naam 
nl|Gilze en Rijen voor de huidige gemeente in gebruik is Hulten was aanvankelijk een van 
nl|Gilze onafhankelijk gebied dat door de Abdis van Thorn in leen was uitgegeven Aan het 
nl|eind van de eeuw werd Hulten bij Gilze gevoegd en het eigen gerecht opgeheven De 
nl|inwoners van Hulten vielen voortaan onder de rechtspraak van de schepenen van Gilze In de 
nl|Tachtigjarige Oorlog had Gilze zwaar te lijden van soldatenbendes Op mei vielen soldaten uit Herentals 
nl|Vilvoorde en Wouw midden in de nacht het dorp Gilze binnen Zij roofden het vee 
nl|en andere goederen en staken de kerk de hoeven en huizen in brand Wat nog 
nl|gered kon worden werd kort daarna geroofd door ruiters uit Antwerpen en Bergen op Zoom 
nl|die toen bovendien verschillende inwoners vermoordden Het dorp verkeerde in een rampzalige toestand De zware 
nl|oorlogslasten maakten de situatie nog erger Zo waren er verplichte leveranties van hooi en haver 
nl|aan de troepen en wagendiensten voor het vervoer van levensmiddelen en munitie naar het Spaanse 
nl|legerkamp bij Antwerpen Veel inwoners verlieten toen hun dorp Zo is bekend dat in verschillende 
nl|kinderen uit Gilze in Breda werden gedoopt De beëindiging van de Tachtigjarige Oorlog betekende nog 
nl|geen verbetering voor Gilze en Rijen Omdat Gilze door de Abdis was uitgeleend kregen de 
nl|inwoners te maken met zware belastingen en de oude gehandhaafde stedelijke voorrechten Twee eeuwen later 
nl|werd weer vuur aangestoken in werd de nieuw gebouwde schuurkerk met een groot aantal huizen 
nl|in de as gelegd na brandstichting in de schuurkerk Ook de herhaalde inkwartiering van troepen 
nl|in het dorp bracht zware lasten voor de bevolking mee Bij de belegering van Breda 
nl|door Spinola in hadden soldaten een kamp in Gilze In vond hier een grote militaire 
nl|oefening plaats De inkwartiering tijdens de Franse Revolutie in de Belgische opstand in en de 
nl|daaropvolgende jaren waren moeilijk voor de Gilzenaren Legerdiensten en verplichte leveranties waren voor de inwoners 
nl|dagelijkse kost Het kamp Vijf Eiken bij Rijen waaraan het Oosterhoutse industrieterrein zijn naam ontleent 
nl|is nog een herinnering aan deze tijd Naast de landbouw kwam in de eeuw de 
nl|leerlooierij op gang Leerlooien werd destijds nog als nevenactiviteit uitgeoefend op de boerderij De officiële 
nl|ingebruikname van de spoorlijn BredaTilburg op oktober betekende vooral voor Rijen een mogelijkheid tot verdere 
nl|uitbreiding van de industrie De spoorlijn garandeerde immers de aanvoer van grondstoffen Daarnaast maakte de 
nl|toepassing van snelwerkende extracten waardoor het looiproces aanzienlijk kon worden verkort het gebruik van machines 
nl|in de eeuw mogelijk Er ontstonden leerfabrieken waarmee de basis gelegd was voor de schoenindustrie 
nl|Sinds het begin van de eeuw werd de productie van schoenen geconcentreerd in een aantal 
nl|grote of kleine fabrieken Voor die tijd werden de schoenen handmatig door thuiswerkers in elkaar 
nl|gezet In de gemeente bestonden ook enkele steenbakkerijen De steenfabriek in Rijen het eerste bedrijf 
nl|van enige omvang dat zich hier na de aanleg van de spoorlijn vestigde was de 
nl|grootste en modernste steenfabriek in NoordBrabant Nu is deze fabriek gesloten Naast de schoen en 
nl|lederfabrieken vestigde zich in de NV Electrische Weegwerktuigenfabriek nu Ericsson Telecommunicatie BV in Rijen In 
nl|werd op de Molenheide de Eerste Nederlandsche Vliegvereeniging ENV opgericht de eerste vliegschool in Nederland 
nl|en de enige instantie die vliegbrevetten uit mocht reiken zonder voorafgaande ministeriële beschikking Vanaf kwam 
nl|het vliegveld steeds meer in handen van de Luchtvaartafdeeling voorloper van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht Op 
nl|de Molenheide en de Nerhovensche Heide werd toen de grondslag gelegd voor de huidige vliegbasis 
nl|GilzeRijen Oostelijker werd eind jaren dertig voor burgergebruik Vliegveld Nerhoven aangelegd maar dit werd in

nl|De heraldiek is ontstaan als de beschrijving van de wapenschilden en herkenningstekens van de kruisridders 
nl|en de bewapende ridders en deelnemers aan toernooien in de Middeleeuwen De oorsprong in de 
nl|kruistochten waarbij veel ridders een kruis op hun schild of mantel plaatsten verklaart waarom het 
nl|kruis in de Europese heraldiek zoveel aandacht kreeg In de eeuw was het kruis het 
nl|symbool bij uitstek van het christendom geworden De kruisridders die tegen de mohammedanen heidenen of 
nl|ketters vochten konden in het kruis op hun schild een symbool van hun religie zien 
nl|Op wapenschilden van Joden en op wapenschilden van nietchristenen zoals de Japanse keizer en de 
nl|Indiase vorsten komen geen kruisen voor Een kruis kan een deel van een sprekend wapen 
nl|zijn Een familie Zwartkruis Kruiskamp of De la Croix kan een kruis als ware het 
nl|een rebus in het wapen plaatsen Desondanks waren er vanaf de eeuw ook veel andere 
nl|afbeeldingen zoals geometrische patronen herautstukken genaamd en wapendieren waarbij vooral leeuw en adelaar veel voorkwamen 
nl|kruisen zijn altijd populair gebleven Ook in de Faleristiek de hulpwetenschap die de tekenen van 
nl|de ridderorden beschrijft komen de hier beschreven kruisen veel voor In de heraldiek is het 
nl|kruis een oud symbool ouder dan het christendom dat in meer dan duizend soorten voorkomt 
nl|zoals Veel ridderorden voerden in hun standaard een kruis Nog altijd hebben eretekens meestal de 
nl|vorm van een ridderkruis Een aantal landen voert het kruis in hun vlag zoals Zwitserland 
nl|en de Scandinavische landen Het is tevens het symbool van vele westerse gezondheidsinstellingen en organisaties 
nl|waaronder het Rode Kruis dat een kruis van Genève gebruikt De rijkdom aan vormen van 
nl|de kruisen is gebaseerd op de noodzaak om een afwijkend wapenschild te maken Had een 
nl|andere familie al een zwart kruis op goud dan koos een volgende ridder een zwart 
nl|gegolfd kruis en de daaropvolgende een kruis "van het een in het ander" In principe 
nl|behoort ieder wapenschild immers uniek te zijn en tegelijk zo eenvoudig mogelijk vormgegeven te worden 
nl|in verband met de herkenbaarheid Dat verklaart de vormen van de kruisen In de heraldiek 
nl|worden vele honderden kruisen gebruikt Ieder kruis kan immers als schuinkruis en verkort of lang 
nl|het hele veld bedekkend worden afgebeeld Dan kan de heraldicus de kruisen van een afwijkende 
nl|voet of rand voorzien verhogen of met kleuren en tinctuuren metalen verschillen aangeven Ten slotte 
nl|kan men binnen het kruis nog figuren plaatsen Het kruis heet dan "beladen met figuren" 
nl|zoals leeuwenkoppen of andreaskruisen te zijn In naziDuitsland werden onderscheidingen en wapenschilden veelvuldig met swastika's 
nl|het symbool van de NSDAP versierd In de Bondsrepubliek en de DDR werd daaraan een 
nl|eind gemaakt In Finland zijn de hakenkruisen in de kleinoden van Finse onderscheidingen in slechts 
nl|één geval verwijderd; de keten van de vaak aan Europese staatshoofden verleende Orde van de 
nl|Witte Roos Finland werd in van de prominent afgebeelde hakenkruisen ontdaan In de versierselen van 
nl|de Orde van het Vrijheidskruis Finland en ook op de standaard van de Finse president 
nl|wordt de swastika nog steeds In de familiewapens van de Nederlandse en Vlaamse families Dröge 
nl|de Koning Sonnema Ebbinge en van den Elzas komen swastika's Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog heeft 
nl|menigeen het hakenkruis in het familiewapen vervangen door een ander ornament De namen van de 
nl|kruisen werden door Nederlandse schrijvers tot in de eeuw meestal in het Frans gegeven Er 
nl|was geen overeenstemming over de Nederlandse namen Johannes Rietstap en Joan Graafland waren gezaghebbende autoriteiten 
nl|op het gebied van de heraldiek en zij hebben een algemeen aanvaard Nederlands begrippenapparaat voorgesteld 
nl|dat nu algemeen is overgenomen Het kruis van SintJoris is het basismodel van de meeste 
nl|heraldische kruisen Het Andreaskruis of schuinkruis is het tweede archetype van de heraldische kruisen Voorbeelden 
nl|van Andreaskruisen vindt u onder op deze pagina Er is in de loop der eeuwen 
nl|veel gevarieerd op deze eenvoudige vorm In het overzicht staan de door Rietstap en Jhr

nl|telefoonnetten aan Maar met Leeuwarden kwam de NBTM in twee jaar onderhandelen niet tot overeenstemming 
nl|en in vroeg de Friese hoofdstad andere bedrijven om naar de opdracht te dingen De 
nl|keus tussen twee gegadigden viel daarna op Ribbink Van Bork dat het net aanlegde Op 
nl|oktober werd met de exploitatie begonnen In de Leeuwarder Courant kondigde de firma aan dat 
nl|er een geregelde telefoondienst van zeven uur ‘s morgens tot elf uur ‘s avonds onderhouden 
nl|zou worden terwijl de abonnees ‘s nachts verbonden waren met de politie De telefooncentrale stond 
nl|op de zolder van het politiebureau Onder dezelfde formule volgden andere plaatsen zoals Deventer Middelburg 
nl|'sHertogenbosch Tilburg Vlissingen en Zwolle Voor het interlokaal verbinden van deze netten kreeg het bedrijf

nl|dat de NBTM die echter alleen de eigen netwerken met elkaar In beheerde de firma 
nl|die inmiddels kantoor hield op Keizersgracht in Amsterdam tien lokale netwerken In dat jaar stagneerden 
nl|de particuliere initiatieven doordat de gemeenten Amsterdam Rotterdam en Arnhem de concessies van de NBTM 
nl|niet verlengden en zelf de exploitatie van het telefoonnet overnamen De Tweede Kamer debatteerde in 
nl|die dagen over de vraag of de telefoon een overheidstaak zou moeten worden Op oktober 
nl|nam het Rijk de aanleg van interlokale verbindingen over In het volgende jaar werd een 
nl|wetsontwerp ingediend voor de aanleg van een secundair interlokaal netwerk buiten de Randstad De Tweede 
nl|Kamer verwierp deze wet uit vrees voor een marginalisatie van de plaatsen die niet in 
nl|de plannen waren opgenomen In dezelfde periode hield de gemeenteraad van Leeuwarden de verlenging van 
nl|de concessie met nog eens vijftien jaar vanaf voor Ribbink Van Bork tegen omdat er 
nl|in het kleine netwerk geen vooruitgang zat Er was een vicieuze cirkel ontstaan van onvoldoende

nl|geschiedenis van de hertogen van Brabant waarheidsgetrouw wou weergeven De Brabantse Zwaanriddersage doet hij net 
nl|zoals Jacob van Maerlant als leugen af In het vijfde boek schreef Jan van Boendale 
nl|over zijn eigen tijd De kroniek vertegenwoordigt zonder twijfel het Brabantse standpunt en is niet

nl|Zijn vader Feiko Sipkes kweekte aardbeien en bracht hem in contact met Jac P Thijsse 
nl|gezien Cees' voorkeur voor wilde planten Na het gymnasium in Haarlem volgde Sipkes een opleiding 
nl|aan de tuinbouwschool in Aalsmeer Cees had een zuster die ruim anderhalf jaar jonger dan 
nl|hij In begon Sipkes mede op aanraden van Thijsse een kwekerij van wilde planten Hij 
nl|noemde die “De Teunisbloem” Dat was een eerbetoon aan de hoogleraar Hugo de Vries die 
nl|op basis van kruisingen van de teunisbloem zijn mutatietheorie had bedacht De kwekerij was gevestigd 
nl|aan de Zijlweg tussen Haarlem en Overveen Zijn uitgangspunt was dat de wilde flora in 
nl|tuin en park kan worden toegepast Menig tuinontwerp werd volgens deze conceptie door hem gemaakt 
nl|en Sipkes was al toen de Nederlandse Jeugdbond voor Natuurstudie NJN werd opgericht in en 
nl|kon vanwege de leeftijdsgrens van deze bond geen lid meer worden Maar hij fungeerde wel 
nl|als begeleider op kampen Hij was ook actief lid van de Koninklijke Nederlandse Natuurhistorische Vereniging 
nl|In publiceerde hij een artikel in De Levende Natuur over het kweken van wilde Daarin 
nl|zette hij uiteen dat hij niet alles kweekte maar een “aantal soorten had uitgekozen die 
nl|opvallen door schoonheid bijzondere biologische eigenschappen of omdat ze kenmerkend zijn voor het karakter van 
nl|het landschap geschikt voor rotspartijen voor droge terreinen of voor duinen aan zee” Ook hier 
nl|ontbreken de zelfgemaakte foto's oa van planten op zijn eigen kwekerij niet Hij riep op 
nl|om voorzichtig te zijn met het verzamelen van planten in het wild tenzij er sprake 
nl|is van “ontginningen” van natuurgebieden waar hij dan weer graag van op de hoogte wilde 
nl|worden gesteld In stopte Sipkes met “De Teunisbloem” en ging hij op Voorne wonen en 
nl|werken Hij werd er beheersadviseur van het Administratiefonds Rotterdam Dit fonds beheerde een deel van 
nl|Voornes Duin een gebied vanaf in beheer bij het ZuidHollands Landschap Hij trad tijdelijk ook

nl|op Hij was behalve kweker en adviseur vier jaar docent aan de Hogere Opleiding voor 
nl|Tuinarchitectuur te Cees Sipkes reisde veel en hield voordrachten over zijn reizen onder andere voor

nl|Spanje Italië en de Balkanlanden Hij schreef ook over zijn reizen bijvoorbeeld over een botanische

nl|te leggen en te beplanten Thijsse's Hof was de eerste heemtuin van Nederland ontworpen door 
nl|Leonard Anthony Springer in nauw overleg met Jac P De samenwerking met Springer moet niet 
nl|altijd eenvoudig geweest zijn Zo liet de gemeente Bloemendaal met toestemming van Springer veel voedselarm 
nl|zand afvoeren en zwarte grond opbrengen Daar was Sipkes en ook Thijsse tegen omdat een 
nl|grote voedselrijkdom voor een tuin van wilde planten door hem minder geschikt werd Sipkes bleef 
nl|zijn hele leven als bezoeker en adviseur betrokken bij de Hof en bracht ook vaak 
nl|zaden en plantmateriaal “Op Voorne ontplooide Sipkes zijn talenten als natuurbeschermer en natuurbeheerder Hij bezat

nl|Rotterdam legde Sipkes in bij Rockanje in een gebied dat door de Duitse bezetters in 
nl|de Tweede Wereldoorlog was afgeplagd en ontzand het heempark "De Tenellaplas" Dit was een landschapstuin 
nl|van enkele hectaren groot In de tuin werd met een zandzuiger een ha grote duinplas 
nl|uitgegraven met geleidelijk aflopende oevers Daardoor ontstond een natvochtigdrooggradiënt met een grote soortenrijkdom Gegeven Sipkes 
nl|belangstelling kwam er een groot aantal soorten orchideeën in de tuin De strijd tegen de 
nl|konijnen een andere passie van Sipkes kreeg hier ook veel In de omgeving kwam op 
nl|vrij grote schaal het zeldzame teer guichelheil Anagallis tenella Dat inspireerde Sipkes tot de naam 
nl|van het heempark Het gehele terrein omvatte ongeveer ha Sipkes hoopte dat er zich na 
nl|het afgraven op de oostelijke flauwglooiende oever een vegetatie zou kunnen ontwikkelen zoals die in 
nl|jonge duinvalleien voorkomt met fraai duizendguldenkruid Centaureum pulchellum knopige vetmuur Sagina nodosa parnassia Parnassia palustris 
nl|orchideeën en gentianen Hij verwachtte dat als de konijnen zouden wegblijven de flora na ongeveer 
nl|jaar op haar hoogtepunt zou kunnen Na jaar was het terrein uitgegroeid tot het “instructief 
nl|plantsoen 'De Tenellaplas'” Ook noemde Sipkes het toen al een “heempark” waarvan de aanleg zo 
nl|merkte hij op weliswaar niet direct als 'natuurbescherming' gezien kan worden maar toch in hoge 
nl|mate de natuurbeschermingsgedachte bij de bezoekers bevordert ons leert over het beheer van natuurterreinen en 
nl|ons een richting van landschapsarchitectuur laat zien die door velen gewaardeerd In hij was toen 
nl|inmiddels jaar oud was Sipkes “de man van de Tenellaplas” geworden Terugkijkend op zijn leven 
nl|vertelde hij met enige trots dat hij in de eerste was die in praktijk bracht 
nl|dat wilde flora in tuinen en parken kon worden ingepast Anno konden rond de Tenellaplas 
nl|soorten planten worden geteld waaronder soorten orchideeën en was Sipkes nog niet van plan met 
nl|zijn werkzaamheden in het heempark aan de Tenellaplas te Op zijn negentigste verjaardag mocht Sipkes

nl|ongelukje vindt sic ik het een aanwinst wanneer planten zich vanuit het park in de

nl|dit vraagstuk uitgebreid in een artikel in het “Sipkesnummer” van het tijdschrift In leverde Sipkes

nl|Utevolk Hun economie was eeuwenlang gebaseerd op de jacht visvangst en voedselverzameling Naast hun thuisregio's 
nl|in Colorado en Utah jaagden de Uta ook in gebieden tot in Wyoming Oklahoma en 
nl|New Mexico Ze hadden heilige plaatsen die buiten hun eigen streek lagen maar die ze 
nl|wel enkele keren per jaar bezochten seizoenaal De Ute kenden specifieke spirituele en ceremoniële gebruiken 
nl|Er waren twaalf historische groepen Ute Hun cultuur werd uiteraard beïnvloed door naburige Indianenstammen De 
nl|Ute leefden gewoonlijk in familieverband maar kwamen als groep tezamen voor ceremonies en handel De 
nl|Ute handelden ook met andere Indianenstammen zoals de Puebloindianen Bij de eerste contacten met de

nl|mobieler en men kon anders gaan jagen maar ook de organisatie binnen de stam werd 
nl|beïnvloed Voordien waren de Ute voornamelijk defensief georiënteerd op militair vlak maar dankzij de paarden 
nl|werden de Ute goede paardrijders en krijgers die andere Indianenstammen gingen overvallen Het aanzien binnen 
nl|de stam werd nu gebaseerd op het aantal paarden dat men had en hoe goed 
nl|men kon paardrijden Vanaf het midden van de negentiende eeuw werden de Ute gaandeweg verdreven 
nl|van hun oorspronkelijke thuisregio's door goudzoekers en kolonisten De Ute sloten enkele verdragen om nog

nl|Gerardus Johannes Wiarda Amsterdam september – Den Haag juni was een Nederlands jurist Hij specialiseerde 
nl|zich in het bestuursrecht Zijn publicaties hadden een civielrechtelijke invalshoek en ze gingen over het 
nl|snijvlak tussen het publiek en privaatrecht Ook trok hij vaak parallellen met het burgerlijk recht 
nl|Gerardus Johannes Wiarda werd geboren op september in een protestants gezin Zijn vader was rechter 
nl|Hij ging naar het Barlaeus gymnasium in zijn geboorteplaats In begon hij aan een studie 
nl|rechten aan de Gemeente Universiteit van Amsterdam Zijn studie voltooide hij in Het jaar erop 
nl|ging hij aan de slag als advocaat Hij was slechts voor een krappe twee jaar 
nl|advocaat terugkijkend vond hij zichzelf geen goed advocaat Hierbij moet wel gezegd worden dat Wiarda 
nl|een bescheiden man was die zelfkritiek niet schuwde Het ambt van rechter paste echter beter 
nl|bij hem En zo begon in zijn carrière bij de rechtelijke macht als Secretaris van 
nl|de Raad van Beroep voor de directe belastingen in Amsterdam In werd hij tevens in 
nl|Amsterdam rechterplaatsvervanger Eind jaren dertig verving hij een zieke kinderrechter waardoor hij veel meer tijd 
nl|kwijt was aan zijn functie als rechterplaatsvervanger In tijdens de oorlog werd hij dan ook 
nl|rechter Wiarda ervoer het kinderrechterschap als emotioneel zwaar In deze periode verdiepte hij zich ook 
nl|in het Jansenisme Port Royal en Blaise Pascal hetgeen van invloed zou blijven op zijn 
nl|latere werk Ook was hij rechtercommissaris in de strafzaak tegen de meestervervalser Han van Meegeren 
nl|In promoveerde Wiarda bij Paul Scholten cum laude op het proefschrift Overeenkomsten met Overheden waarin 
nl|hij enkele gedachten ontvouwde die later bijdroegen aan de ontwikkeling van het bestuursrecht in Nederland 
nl|en ook voor de ontwikkeling van publiekprivate samenwerkingsverbanden Hij refereerde hierin vaak aan het burgerlijk 
nl|recht Het administratief recht kreeg hierdoor iets eigens iets unieks De stijl van het proefschrift 
nl|is rustig zonder polemiek of andere stijlmiddelen om het proefschrift een eigen originaliteit te geven 
nl|Deze stijl is vrij kenmerkend voor sommige van zijn andere publicaties Hij hield dan ook 
nl|niet van discussies over theoretische uitgangspunten of over de vorm als je toch tot hetzelfde 
nl|resultaat zou komen Het snijvlak tussen publiek en privaatrecht dat hij in zijn proefschrift behandelt 
nl|is een terugkerend thema in zijn publicaties In werd hij benoemd tot hoogleraar Administratief Recht 
nl|aan de Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht Hij aanvaardde het ambt met de rede De wetenschap van het 
nl|bestuursrecht en de spanning tussen gezag en gerechtigheid Zijn loopbaan als hoogleraar zou maar kort 
nl|duren en hij heeft zich nooit helemaal op zijn plaats gevoeld aan de Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht 
nl|Dit kwam deels omdat hij zichzelf te onervaren vond in een bestuursfunctie maar ook omdat 
nl|hij zichzelf als generalist zag en niet als iemand die zich vooral op één rechtsgebied 
nl|toelegde In werd hij benoemd tot raadsheer in de Hoge Raad der Nederlanden waar na 
nl|de Tweede Wereldoorlog ten gevolge van de zuivering vacatures openvielen Gedurende zijn lidmaatschap van de 
nl|Hoge Raad was hij actief als bestuurder onder meer van de Stichting Custodia te Parijs 
nl|nauw verwant aan het Institut Néerlandais In publiceerde hij het preadvies algemene beginselen van behoorlijk 
nl|bestuur voor de Verenging van Administratief Recht Dit preadvies speelde een belangrijke rol bij de 
nl|verdere uitwerking van de algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur Zijn belangrijkste werk is het essay 
nl|Drie Typen van Rechtsvinding uit dat later zelfstandig uitgegeven tientallen jaren tot de standaardliteratuur van 
nl|alle Nederlandse rechtenstudenten zou behoren Drie Typen van Rechtsvinding borduurt voort op een werk van 
nl|zijn leermeester Scholten namelijk Algemeen deel van de Asserserie De denkwijze van Wiarda is naar 
nl|eigen zeggen ook beïnvloed door Meijers wiens gedachtegoed hij heeft meegekregen via FJ de Jong 
nl|Maar hij bleef toch bovenal een aanhanger van de opvattingen van zijn leermeester In Drie 
nl|Typen van Rechtsvinding baseert hij de drie typen op een vergelijking van Montesquieu Van tot

nl|Het Serapeum in het Grieks Serapeion van Memphis is de tempel die gewijd was aan 
nl|de syncretische god Serapis In Alexandrië bestond er eveneens een Serapeum maar dit was pas 
nl|ontstaan in de Hellenistische tijd en had veel meer een Grieks karakter De tempel in 
nl|Memphis is vooral gekend omwille van zijn begraafplaats voor de Apisstieren Het Serapeum bevond zich 
nl|net buiten het vruchtbare Nijldal op de westrand van de woestijn De tempel was in 
nl|de Ptolemaeische periode een belangrijk cultureel centrum maar de oudste restanten van de tempel dateren 
nl|al uit de veertiende eeuw vChr De tempel was vanaf de achttiende dynastie in gebruik 
nl|en in de onderaardse gewelven is de zoon van Ramses II Chaemwase begraven Later werd 
nl|de er in de tempel de syncretische god Osorapis Osiris en Apis vereerd Psammetichus I 
nl|zorgde voor een restauratie van de tempel en Nectanebo I vergrootte de tempel met onder 
nl|andere een mortuarium voor de gestorven Apisstieren In de Hellenistische tijd werd naast Apis ook 
nl|Serapis grotendeels aanbeden naast verschillende andere goden In de Romeinse tijd verloor het Serapeum steeds 
nl|meer aan belang en werden enkel de fundamenten gespaard van vernieling De tempel raakte helemaal 
nl|bedolven onder het zand tot Auguste Mariette een van de eerste egyptologen de tempel opgroef 
nl|Om ons een beeld te scheppen van de tempel zijn we onder andere aangewezen op 
nl|schriftelijke bronnen De Griekse geograaf en historicus Strabo leert ons het volgende over het uitzicht 
nl|van de tempel Strabo Geografie XVII I Er is ook een Serapeum bij Memphis op 
nl|een plaats die zo zanderig is dat er door de wind duinen van zand worden 
nl|opgehoopt Daaronder zijn de sfinxen die ik gezien heb soms wel tot aan het hoofd 
nl|bedolven anderen waren nog voor de helft zichtbaar De tempel was omgeven door een muur 
nl|van driehonderd op driehonderd meter Binnen deze muur stonden naast de Osorapistempel verschillende tempels voor 
nl|andere goden zoals Isis Horus Amon Thoth en Astarte In het oosten bevond zich de 
nl|toegangspoort met een dromos Aan het begin van deze dromos stond er een apsis met 
nl|elf beelden van Griekse dichters en wijsgeren Tegenover deze beelden eindigde een sfinxenlaan van meter 
nl|die vertrok vanuit het Anoubieion Er moeten ongeveer vierhonderd van deze sfinxen geweest waarvan er 
nl|enkele tientallen teruggevonden zijn De sfinxen waren omgeven door een muurtje Zoals Strabo aantoont kon 
nl|het muurtje niet genoeg bescherming bieden tegen de aanhoudende zandophopingen In de tempel was er 
nl|plaats voor plengoffers ter ere van Asklepios een god die nauw verbonden was met Serapis 
nl|Er zijn echter geen aanwijzingen dat er in het Serapeum een incubatieruimte voor genezing was 
nl|zoals in andere tempel voor Asklepios wel het geval was Tussen al deze tempeltjes was 
nl|er binnen de muren van het Serapeum nog een grote ruimte die gevuld was met 
nl|winkeltjes woonhuizen en herbergen Er was zelfs een speciale ruimte voor als de koning op 
nl|bezoek kwam Buiten de muren van het Serapeum lag een menselijke begraafplaats maar het Serapeum 
nl|van Memphis kreeg vooral bekendheid als bewaarplaats van gemummificeerde stieren Deze stieren waren tijdens hun 
nl|leven vereerd als de levende verschijning van de god Apis en ze werden volgens Herodotos 
nl|uitgekozen aan de hand van enkele bijzondere kenmerken De stieren werden gezien als de god 
nl|Apis op aarde en daarom werden ze tijdens hun leven goed verzorgd in de tempel 
nl|Bij hun dood werden ze gebalsemd en bijgezet in de begraafplaats voor stieren De stieren 
nl|werden al sinds de veertiende eeuw gehouden Van deze stieren werden er nauwkeurige lijsten bijgehouden 
nl|met de naam en de leeftijd van de stieren In totaal zouden hier vierenzestig stieren 
nl|worden begraven De eerste stieren kregen nog een enkelvoudig graf terwijl er later werd overgeschakeld 
nl|op gemeenschappelijke begraafplaatsen Uit de Romeinse tijd kennen we slechts één stier en de cultus 
nl|van Apis nam steeds meer af tot ze helemaal verdween Het Anoubieion waarmee het Serapeum 
nl|was verbonden richtten de Egyptenaren op ter ere van de als jakhals voorgestelde god Anubis 
nl|die de beschermgod van de balseming was De tempel was opgericht door Amasis en later

nl|geschilderd rond x centimeter groot Het is een voorbeeld van de vaak geprezen aquarelleerkunst van 
nl|de Haagse Scholers waarvan Weissenbruch een belangrijke exponent was Het werk bevindt zich sinds in 
nl|de collectie van het Rijksmuseum Amsterdam na een schenking door het kunstverzamelaarsechtpaar DruckerFraser Weissenbruch was 
nl|opgeleid in de romantische traditie maar schakelde in de jaren over op een meer realistische 
nl|manier van werken veelal "en plein air" Daarmee zou hij gerekend gaan worden tot de 
nl|eerste generatie van de Haagse School In de jaren begon hij steeds vaker te aquarelleren 
nl|een snelle manier van werken die goed paste bij het werken in de open lucht 
nl|Hij groeide uit tot een van de belangrijkste aquarellisten van zijn tijd en droeg sterk 
nl|bij tot faam die de Haagse School in deze kunstvorm zou verwerven Weissenbruch maakte vaak 
nl|een hele reeks tekeningen en aquarellen op locatie en vervolgens werkte hij die beetje bij 
nl|beetje in zijn atelier af Daarbij vergeleek hij zijn werken soms met patiënten "Ik verbeeld 
nl|mij soms dat ik een dokter ben in een hospitaal en dat die tekeningen allemaal 
nl|mijn patiënten zijn En als ik dan zo rondwandel zie ik er een die mij 
nl|zo duivels bleek lijkt en dan zeg ik wacht eens even ik zal voor jou 
nl|eens wat klaar maken en dan probeer ik hem eens wat op te knappen Sommige 
nl|hebben weleens een hele operatie nodig om terecht te komen Die daar in den hoek

nl|De oevers zijn uitgewerkt in donkergroene tinten en grauwe schaduwkleuren welke afsteken tegen de lavendelblauwe 
nl|hemel die weerspiegelt in het water De verdwijnende rivier schept perspectivische ruimte Het centrum van 
nl|het licht lijkt in het verdwijnpunt te schuilen waarmee hij eens te meer benadrukt dat 
nl|alles in het werk ondergeschikt is aan het licht Opvallend in dit schilderij is dat 
nl|Weissenbruch – anders dan in zijn eerdere werken – niet volledig kiest voor een onbedorven 
nl|natuuromgeving Met de afbeelding van de rond gerealiseerde Schipperse brug later in de plaatselijke omgeving 
nl|ook wel de Weissenbruch brug genoemd voegt hij een min of meer modern element toe 
nl|hetgeen een tegenwicht biedt voor het nostalgische karakter van het thema Het geeft een bijzondere 
nl|spanning en tegelijkertijd evenwicht aan dit werk Hij zou de ophaalbrug meerdere malen tekenen en 
nl|aquarelleren Bestudering van deze aquarellen leert dat ze vanuit een eerste snelle opzet veelvuldig zijn

nl|met Oliver Lodge Oliver Heaviside en Heinrich Hertz was hij een van de leidende figuren 
nl|in de groep van Maxwellians die James Maxwells theorie van het elektromagnetisch veld herzag uitbreidde 
nl|verduidelijkte en bevestigde aan het einde van de eeuw In na de publicatie van de 
nl|Wetten van Maxwell suggereerde hij een apparaat om een snel oscillerende elektrische stroom te veroorzaken 
nl|om op die manier elektromagnetische golven te produceren een fenomeen dat voor het eerst experimenteel 
nl|was aangetoond door Heinrich Hertz Hij is echter het bekendst voor zijn aanname in dat 
nl|alle bewegende voorwerpen lengtecontractie ondervinden in de richting van hun beweging Dit zou het toen 
nl|vreemde resultaat van het MichelsonMorleyexperiment verklaren FitzGerald baseerde zijn idee gedeeltelijk op de manier waarop 
nl|bekend was dat elektromagnetische krachten beïnvloed werden door beweging Dit baseerde hij op vergelijkingen die 
nl|waren afgeleid door zijn vriend Oliver Heaviside De Nederlandse natuurkundige Hendrik Lorentz kwam op een 
nl|vergelijkbaar idee in en werkte dat uit in meer detail in zijn theorie over elektronen

nl|Een staalkabel is een kabel bestaande uit stalen draden die rond een kern zijn geslagen 
nl|Een staalkabel dient om trekkrachten over te brengen bijvoorbeeld bij hijswerk liften lieren tuibruggen en 
nl|kabelbanen Een staalkabel bestaat uit draden die tot strengen worden geslagen Deze worden bij meerstrengskabels 
nl|rond een kern tot een kabel geslagen Op hun beurt kunnen staalkabels worden geslagen tot 
nl|een strop of een grommer een staalkabel zonder einde Om een staalkabel te kunnen gebruiken 
nl|is een eindverbinding nodig waarmee deze bevestigd kan worden aan het te hijsen trekken of 
nl|slepen voorwerp Een voordeel van staal ten opzichte van plantaardige touwvezels is dat staal een 
nl|grotere trekkracht per oppervlakteeenheid kan opnemen en bovendien niet rekt en krimpt met het veranderen 
nl|van de luchtvochtigheid alleen met het veranderen van de temperatuur Het is bovendien een materiaal 
nl|waarvan men de eigenschappen tijdens productie onder controle heeft Dat is bij nietmetalen veel moeilijker 
nl|Kabels gemaakt van huid haar en plantenvezels zijn al bekend uit de prehistorie Zonder touw 
nl|hadden de piramides en tempels in het oude Egypte niet gebouwd kunnen worden In de 
nl|oudheid werd de fabricage van touw verfijnd waarna er tot de negentiende eeuw weinig veranderde 
nl|Tegen die tijd werd ijzer een alternatief onder meer bij de bouw van hangbruggen Zo 
nl|werd bij een hangbrug over de Schuylkill River in de Verenigde Staten in gebruikgemaakt van 
nl|ijzerdraad terwijl ook in Schotland en Frankrijk de nodige hangbruggen werden gebouwd Vooral in Frankrijk 
nl|werd daarbij ook de theorie verder ontwikkeld onder meer door Navier Vicat Dufourt en Seguin 
nl|De doorbraak waarbij meerdere draden en strengen tot kabel werden geslagen ontstond echter in de 
nl|mijnbouw in Duitsland Waar touw niet voldeed maakte men wel gebruik van ketting Mijningenieur Julius 
nl|Albert in Clausthal zag de voordelen van beide de hoge treksterkte van de ijzeren ketting 
nl|en de parallel dragende strengen van kabels Dat laatste was een probleem bij kettingen waar 
nl|vermoeiingsbreuken bij gebruik in de mijnbouw bijzonder gevaarlijk waren aangezien bij een enkele breuk de 
nl|gehele ketting faalt Bij kabels wordt de breuk van een enkele draad opgevangen door de 
nl|andere draden en kunnen er zelfs vele draadbreuken zijn zonder dat de kabel als geheel 
nl|faalt Tussen en werkte hij aan deze problematiek waarbij hij onder meer in een trekbank 
nl|bouwde om kettingen op vermoeiing te beproeven Rond kwam hij tot de conclusie dat kettingen 
nl|de oplossing niet waren en begon hij idee uit te werken om ijzerkabels te fabriceren 
nl|daarbij geholpen door verbeteringen door Mummenthey in het productieproces van ijzerdraad Na de nodige testen 
nl|onder meer met de testopstelling die hij eerder gebruikte voor kettingen begon Albert in met 
nl|de fabricage van een kabel Hij maakte hierbij gebruik van draden van die geleverd werden 
nl|met een lengte van tot meter wat het technisch maximaal haalbare was in die tijd 
nl|Hierdoor was hij gedwongen om de draden op een specifieke wijze te slaan Met vier 
nl|draden maakte hij een streng waarna met drie strengen de uiteindelijke kabel geslagen werd De 
nl|met de hand geslagen kabel had een diameter van en een lengte van meter Terwijl 
nl|touw vrijwel altijd volgens kruisslag werd gefabriceerd koos Albert er opmerkelijk genoeg voor om de 
nl|strengen te slaan in de Langslag Hierdoor lag de kabel beter in de schijven en 
nl|kruisten de strengen elkaar niet Op juli werd de kabel voor het eerst toegepast in 
nl|de meter diepe Carolinegroeve in Clausthal De constructie van de Albertkabel was dusdanig dat elke 
nl|draad van buitenaf geïnspecteerd kon worden iets wat in latere constructies meestal niet meer mogelijk 
nl|is Albert voerde ook de eerste vermoeiingsproeven uit voor buiging Nieuwe ontwerpen met grotere treksterkte 
nl|bleven niet uit Dit vergde meer draden per streng iets waar Albert zelf al aan 
nl|werkte In het Verenigd Koninkrijk hoorde Robert Stirling Newall van de Albertkabel en ontwierp een 
nl|machine om strengen en kabels machinaal te slaan Deze strander sloeg rond een kern van 
nl|hennep zes strengen met elk zes draden rond wederom een kern van hennep Dit had 
nl|wel als nadeel dat de lengte van de rechte kerndraad kleiner was dan die van 
nl|de daaromheen geslagen draden waardoor de kerndraad meer rek kreeg te verduren Ook waren nu 
nl|niet meer alle draden van buitenaf te inspecteren De volgende stap was de meerdere draadlagen 
nl|Om de belasting op de buitenste laag gelijk te houden aan die in de binnenste 
nl|laag werd de draadlengte gelijk gekozen Dit kon worden bereikt door een gelijke slaghoek aan 
nl|te houden De slaglengte verschilde daardoor echter met puntcontacten bij de draadkruisingen die in veel 
nl|draadbreuken resulteerden Een van de oplossingen kwam van Thomas Seale in in zijn werk voor 
nl|California Street Cable Railroad De kabeltrams van San Francisco stelden hoge eisen aan de gebruikte 
nl|kabels De kabel moest buigzaam genoeg zijn om via relatief kleine schijven te kunnen lopen 
nl|terwijl de buitendraden goed bestand moesten zijn tegen slijtage Zo kwam hij tot een ontwerp 
nl|waarbij stevige buitendraden gesteund werden door een gelijk aantal binnendraden Doordat deze een kleinere diameter 
nl|hadden kon de vereiste buigzaamheid verkregen worden Tegelijkertijd wist hij draadkruisingen te voorkomen door de 
nl|slaghoek per laag aan te passen zodat de draden parallel aan elkaar lagen De Sealeconstructie 
nl|werd daarna veel toegepast alleen bleek de kabel door de grote buitendraden toch minder flexibel 
nl|en daardoor gevoeliger voor vermoeiing James B Stone werkzaam voor Washburn Moen verminderde de diameter 
nl|van de buitendraden weer die daardoor ook in aantal moesten toenemen De ruimtes tussen de 
nl|lagen die hierbij ontstonden vulde hij op met draden van kleine diameter Deze filler of 
nl|vuldraadconstructie is tegenwoordig de meest toegepaste staalkabelconstructie Een andere constructie met de parallelslag was die 
nl|waarbij een streng van zes draden rond een kern werd omwikkeld met twaalf draden van 
nl|twee omenom afwisselend diameters Deze constructie werd vernoemd naar Warrington in Engeland destijds een belangrijk 
nl|centrum van kabelfabrikanten Onduidelijk is echter of dit type kabel daar tussen en werd ontwikkeld 
nl|Het eerste idee was zelfs al genoteerd door de Amerikaan John Roebling rond maar hij 
nl|fabriceerde deze kabel nooit zodat niet duidelijk is of zijn ontwerp de basis was voor 
nl|de Engelse kabels Naast de verbeteringen in de constructie werd er ook gezocht naar sterkere 
nl|materialen Met de uitvinding van het Bessemerprocedé genoemd naar Henry Bessemer die daar in een 
nl|patent op verkreeg en het SiemensMartinprocedé van werd het mogelijk om staal in massa te 
nl|produceren Dit was een grote verbetering in treksterkte ten opzichte van het tot dan gebruikte 
nl|smeedijzer Halverwege de twintigste eeuw werd op grote schaal overgestapt op het oxystaalproces De eerste 
nl|toepassing van staalkabels in hangbruggen was in de in voltooide Brooklyn Bridge ontworpen door de 
nl|al genoemde Roebling en zijn zoon Washington Met staal was het echter wel moeilijker werken 
nl|doordat dit stijver was dan ijzer Dit bleef een probleem tot men rond begon met 
nl|het voorvormproces waarbij de draden en strengen al voor het slaan de vorm kregen die 
nl|het in de kabel moest hebben Doordat de draden niet meer wilden terugveren namen interne 
nl|spanningen af en de levensduur van kabels toe Een verdere verbetering was het patenteren een 
nl|warmtebehandeling van walsdraad waardoor deze geschikt wordt voor koude bewerking Het draadtrekken wat maakt dat 
nl|de treksterkte enorm toeneemt werd door deze behandeling eenvoudiger Het proces werd uitgevonden door de 
nl|Brit James Horsfall die het daarna in patenteerde waaraan de behandeling zijn naam ontleent Patent 
nl|voor de behandeling van pianodraad was echter dusdanig vaag dat de concurrentie nog geruime tijd 
nl|na het verlopen van het patent niet in staat was dit te kopiëren De draden 
nl|voor staalkabels worden veelal gemaakt van ongelegeerd staal door draadtrekken of koudwalsen van walsdraad Een 
nl|hoger koolstofgehalte betekent een hogere treksterkte Daarom wordt gekozen voor staven met een hoog koolstofgehalte 
nl|van tussen de Mangaan en silicium worden ook gebruikt om de sterkte te vergroten Naast 
nl|trek wordt een draad ook belast op torsie en bij lopend werk ook op buiging 
nl|Diverse staalsoorten zijn gespecificeerd in Europese normen als EN Er wordt veel gebruik gemaakt van 
nl|staal met een koolstofgehalte van en een structuur van fijn perliet Volgens EN is dit 
nl|staalsoort zijn Verontreinigingen met fosfor en zwavel en sporen van koper chroom nikkel en tin 
nl|zijn onwenselijk omdat deze de ductiliteit doen afnemen De walsdraad die zo wordt gefabriceerd wordt 
nl|daarna aan een warmtebehandeling onderworpen Door dit zogeheten patenteren is het materiaal beter geschikt om 
nl|getrokken te worden Na verwijdering van de walshuid kan dan de draad worden getrokken Hierbij 
nl|wordt deze door meerdere trekstenen getrokken met steeds een kleinere opening Door het trekken vergroot 
nl|de treksterkte en neemt de breekrek af Eventueel kan de draad daarna verzinkt worden om 
nl|corrosie tegen te gaan Profieldraden worden wel gewalst in plaats van getrokken Roestvast staal en 
nl|antimagnetisch materiaal worden in uitzonderlijke gevallen ook wel gebruikt Er zijn vele verschillende draadconstructies afhankelijk 
nl|van de toepassing Elke staalkabel bestaat echter uit een kern waaromheen draden of strengen zijn 
nl|geslagen Als er rond de kern alleen draad is geslagen dan betreft het een enkelstrengskabel 
nl|Bij kabels die over schijven lopen – lopend werk – worden echter over het algemeen 
nl|meerstrengskabels gebruikt Deze kabels kunnen op hun beurt weer rond elkaar geslagen worden Deze kabelslagkabels 
nl|worden als stroppen bij de zeer zware hijsen in de offshore Draden zijn de bouwstenen 
nl|van een staalkabel Ze liggen in een of meer lagen in een bepaald patroon rond 
nl|een kern en vormen zo een streng Deze strengen liggen ook weer rond een kern 
nl|en vormen zo de kabel te vormen De treksterkte van een kabel wordt voor meer 
nl|dan bepaald door de strengen en bij een vezelkern voor Staalkabels die vaak in zeewater 
nl|werken kunnen inwendig geseald met een kunststof Hierdoor wordt niet enkel de corrosie tegengegaan maar 
nl|kunnen ook de strengen beter worden gesmeerd en kan zelfs voorkomen worden dat de strengen 
nl|elkaar aanraken De kern ondersteunt de strengen daaromheen en houdt deze in positie Er zijn 
nl|drie hoofdtypes Een vezelkern fibre core FC bestaat uit kunststof vaak polypropeen of natuurlijke vezels 
nl|als sisal of hennep en is het meest flexibel en elastisch maar wordt gemakkelijk geplet 
nl|Het tweede type met een streng als kern strand core SC wordt meestal alleen gebruikt 
nl|voor zeer kleine kabels Het derde type heeft een streng als kern waarvan de opbouw 
nl|verschilt van de strengen daaromgeen independent wire rope core IWRC Deze is de meest duurzame 
nl|en heeft een grote breukvastheid is sterk heeft een lage rek en is goed bestand 
nl|tegen warmte Veelgebruikt zijn ronde draden maar ook gevormde of geprofileerde draden komen voor Gevormde 
nl|draden worden onder meer gebruikt bij gesloten kabels Hierbij komen Zprofielen fulllocked Hprofielen halflocked en 
nl|trapeziumprofielen voor Driehoekige rechthoekige en ovale profielen worden gebruikt om driehoekige en ovale strengen te 
nl|maken Een streng is geslagen van meerdere draden rond een kerndraad Dit kan een laag 
nl|of tier zijn maar ook meerdere De draden kunnen dezelfde diameter hebben maar voor meer 
nl|veeleisende doeleinden zullen verschillende diamters gekozen worden Met behulp van cijfers wordt aangegeven hoe de 
nl|streng is opgebouwd per laag Dus betekent een kerndraad met een binnenlaag van manteldraden en 
nl|een buitenlaag van manteldraden Voor meerstrengskabels kunnen gelijksoortige strengen worden gebruikt maar ook hiervoor geldt 
nl|dat deze verschillend gekozen kunnen worden naargelang de eisen die eraan worden gesteld Aanvankelijk werd 
nl|elke laag van een streng onder dezelfde slaghoek geslagen met draden van gelijke diameter De 
nl|slaglengte van de buitenlaag was daardoor groter dan die van een binnenlaag terwijl de lagen 
nl|elkaar kruisten Dit resulteerde in puntcontacten bij de draadkruisingen met extra buiging en grote plaatselijke 
nl|dwarsbelasting tot gevolg Dit veroorzaakt weer meer slijtage en daardoor een kortere levensduur terwijl de 
nl|kabel tijdens het gebruik minder soepel wordt De parallelslag vermijdt de genoemde problemen door de 
nl|slaghoek per laag zo aan te passen dat de slaglengte gelijk is Hierdoor kruisen de 
nl|draden elkaar niet meer maar lopen deze parallel en maken daarbij lijncontact in plaats van 
nl|puntcontact De diameter van de draden verschilt hierbij wel per laag Als deze niet goed 
nl|op elkaar zijn afgestemd dan ondersteunen de lagen elkaar onvoldoende Enkele belangrijke parallelconstructies zijn De 
nl|strengen van een Sealeconstructie bestaan uit een kerndraad een binnenlaag van minimaal draden omgeven door 
nl|een buitenlaag met een gelijk aantal draden De buitenste draden zijn dikker dan de binnenste 
nl|Dit is de meest robuuste strengconstructie en heeft een hoge weerstand tegen slijtage door de 
nl|dikke buitendraden maar is daardoor ook tamelijk stijf De vuldraadconstructie filler is heeft dunnere buitendraden 
nl|dan de Sealeconstructie en is daardoor beter bestand tegen sterke buigingen De binnenlaag rond de 
nl|kern bestaat daarbij uit minimaal draden met een buitenlaag van tweemaal zoveel draden De ruimte 
nl|tussen de binnen en buitenlaag wordt daarbij opgevuld met dunne draden Bij dunne kabels kunnen 
nl|de vuldraden erg dun worden en daarmee kwetsbaar In de Warringtonconstructie heeft de buitenlaag het 
nl|dubbele aantal draden waarvan de helft van de draden is dunner dan de andere De 
nl|WarringtonSealeconstructie combineert de Seale en Warringtonconstructie De eerste laag bestaat hierbij uit minimaal draden met 
nl|daaromheen een tweede laag de Warringtonlaag met het dubbele aantal draden afwisselend dik en dun 
nl|De derde laag heeft evenveel draden als de tweede maar deze zijn van gelijke dikte 
nl|Door de drie lagen kan de inwendige wrijving iets groter zijn Zeer hoogwaardige staalkabels worden 
nl|aan de buitenkant soms in een ronde vorm geperst Geperste kabels bieden betere prestaties in 
nl|vergelijking met conventionele kabelconstructies Deze kabels hebben een hogere breekkracht een betere vulling een grotere 
nl|flexibiliteit en een betere contactlijn met schijven dan vergelijkbare conventionele kabels Er zijn twee soorten 
nl|samengeperste kabels met verdichte strengen compacted strands en geperste kabels swaged wire ropes Verdichte strengen 
nl|worden geproduceerd door conventionele strengen gemaakt van ronde draden door een trekijzer te persen Dit 
nl|vervormt de draden gedeeltelijk vermindert de strengdiameter en egaliseert het oppervlak Persen kan ook worden 
nl|toegepast nadat de kabel is vervaardigd Hierbij wordt de gehele kabelomtrek gecomprimeerd waardoor de individuele 
nl|oppervlaktedraden vlak worden en gaten tussen de strengen sluiten De strengen worden op hun beurt 
nl|in een spiraal of schroeflijnvorm rond de kern geslagen De slagrichting kan daarbij rechts right 
nl|hand RH of links left hand LH in kruisslag regular of ordinary lay RL of 
nl|OL in langslag lang lay LL zijn afwisselend om en om alternate lay en afwisselend 
nl|twee om een special alternate lay Als een kabel niet nader wordt gespecificeerd dan betreft 
nl|het een rechtse kruisslag Een rechtse en linkse kabel dienen niet aan elkaar verbonden te 
nl|worden onder kracht aangezien deze elkaar zullen uitdraaien Bij kruisslag liggen de draden evenwijdig aan 
nl|de as van de kabel Dit wordt bereikt door de slagrichting van de strengen tegengesteld 
nl|te maken aan de slagrichting van de draden in de strengen Dit type slag heeft 
nl|een goede knik en draaiweerstand en is goed bestand tegen vervorming Bij de Langslag is 
nl|liggen de draden dwars op de kabelas door de slagrichting van de strengen gelijk te 
nl|maken aan de slagrichting van de draden Dit type slag biedt meer weerstand tegen slijtage 
nl|en flexibeler maar draait sneller uit Zodra een kabel op trek wordt belast zal deze 
nl|een moment ondervinden in een richting tegenovergesteld aan de slagrichting en dus willen uitdraaien Bij 
nl|een draaiarme kabel zijn de verschillende lagen in tegengestelde richting geslagen waarbij de momenten van 
nl|de links geslagen laag die van de rechts geslagen laag ten dele opheft Nadeel is 
nl|dat er puntcontacten bij de draadkruisingen zijn met extra buiging en grote plaatselijke dwarsbelasting tot 
nl|gevolg Dit geeft meer slijtage en kan daardoor een kortere levensduur tot gevolg hebben Ook 
nl|draaiarme constructies zullen enige draaiing ondervinden De treksterkte van een kabel is afhankelijk van de 
nl|sterkte van de individuele strengen en van de vullingsgraad van de kabel Er zijn verschillende 
nl|manieren om staalkabels te slaan zogenaamde langslag of dwarsslagkabels waardoor een betere vullingsgraad te bereiken 
nl|is maar ook vragen sommige toepassingen om bijzondere opbouw van de staalkabel Smering vermindert de 
nl|interne wrijving tussen de draden en strengen en de externe wrijving met trommel en schijven 
nl|bij lopend werk Tijdens de productie worden staalkabels dan ook al voorzien van vet Naast 
nl|deze smerende werking heeft het vet ook een conserverende werking ie de bescherming tegen roestvorming 
nl|Bij een geïmpregneerde vezelkern kan deze gedurende de levensduur de kabel nog smeren Het vet 
nl|gaat echter vooral bij lopend werk na verloop van tijd verloren zodat smering gedurende het 
nl|gebruik de levensduur kan verlengen De gebruikte smering moet dan wel doordringen tot in de 
nl|kern van de kabel Het moet ook voldoende adhesie hebben om zo aan de kabel 
nl|te blijven kleven Zodra er echter corrosie en draadbreuken zijn opgetreden dan is vervanging de 
nl|enige optie Smering zou dan namelijk juist de frictie verminderen die mogelijk de draad nog 
nl|bij elkaar houdt ondanks de draadbreuken Een plotselinge kabelbreuk zou dan het gevolg kunnen zijn 
nl|Voor hef en hijsmiddelen is een periodieke visuele inspectie verplicht dus ook voor staalkabels die 
nl|gebruikt worden bij hijswerk Dit is veelal jaarlijks in het Verenigd Koninkrijk zelfs halfjaarlijks Voor 
nl|België gebeurt dit op basis van van het ARAB en dienen kabels voor hijswerkzaamheden om 
nl|de maanden gekeurd te worden door een EDTC Om aan te geven dat een hijsmiddel 
nl|geïnspecteerd is wordt wel gebruikgemaakt van een jaarkleurensysteem Dit kan een systeem zijn op basis 
nl|van de Internationale Maritieme Organisatie maar er kan ook een eigen systeem worden gebruikt Bij 
nl|staalkabels wordt de markering veelal aangebracht op de eindverbinding Staalkabels kunnen uitwendig gecontroleerd worden door 
nl|met een dot poetskatoen langs de kabel te lopen Bij iedere breuk blijft een pluisje 
nl|hangen Bij te veel draadbreuken moet de kabel afgekeurd worden Een deel van de kabel 
nl|kan ook door middel van destructief testen worden onderzocht Kabels kunnen verder nietdestructief met een 
nl|elektronisch meetinstrument in en uitwendig worden gecontroleerd Door deze elektronische controle kan de toegestane veilige 
nl|levensduur van de kabel behoorlijk worden verlengd Wanneer kabels buiten gebruik moeten worden gesteld is 
nl|afhankelijk van de toepassing Bij hijskranen geeft ISO de nodige criteria zoals draadbreuken kinken kurkentrekkers 
nl|vogelkooien slijtage en corrosie Zogenaamde kurkentrekkers komen vooral voor bij draden met een vezelkern Door 
nl|slijtage van de kern dringt een van de draden steeds verder naar binnen tot deze 
nl|in zijn geheel de plaats van de vezelkern inneemt Dit lijkt dan op een kurkentrekker 
nl|Bij een zogenaamde vogelkooi liggen de strengen van de buitenlaag volledig los van de rest 
nl|van de kabel en vormen als het ware een vogelkooi Om een staalkabel te kunnen

nl|Catenaccio is een voornamelijk in Italië toegepaste speelstijl in het voetbal Catenaccio is het Italiaanse 
nl|woord voor 'grendel' Het is dan ook een systeem dat zich vooral richt op een 
nl|goed georganiseerde en effectieve verdediging die de aanvallen van de opponenten moet neutraliseren Het is 
nl|een combinatie van een verdediging van vier mandekkers in lijn ondersteund door een libero in 
nl|Nederland ook wel 'laatste man' genoemd Het systeem is bekend geworden doordat de Argentijnse coach 
nl|Helenio Herrera bij Internazionale er veel gebruik van maakte in de jaren zestig Inter won 
nl|in die tijd dan ook geregeld wedstrijden met uitslagen als of met weinig tegendoelpunten Het 
nl|catenacciosysteem werd erg beïnvloed door een tactiek van de voormalige Oostenrijkse coach Karl Rappan genaamd 
nl|"verrou" Frans voor Als bondscoach van Zwitserland in de jaren dertig en veertig had Rappan 
nl|dit systeem ingevoerd Achter de verdediger werd nog een extra voetballer neergezet genaamd de verrouilleur 
nl|Deze speler was extreem defensief ingesteld en speelde maar net voor de doelman In de 
nl|jaren vijftig werd deze tactiek verder uitgewerkt door Nereo Rocco die coach van Padova Calcio 
nl|Inter nam de speelstijl later over Rappans verrousysteem werd uitgevoerd door een viermans defensie met 
nl|daarbij een libero achter drie 'normale' verdedigers Daarnaast was er sprake van een strikte mandekking 
nl|een spelmaker in het midden en daarnaast twee buitenste middenvelders Ten slotte waren er twee 
nl|spitsen met een aanvallende middenvelder daarachter Het systeem van Rocco ook weleens het 'eerste echte' 
nl|catenaccio genoemd werd bekend toen hij in werkzaam was bij US Triestina Hij speelde voornamelijk 
nl|met een en speelde erg defensief Met deze catenaccio werd de club verrassend tweede in 
nl|de Serie A De belangrijkste verandering die toegepast werd op de catenaccio was het toevoegen 
nl|van een libero "vrije" verdediger die in het Nederlands ook bekend is als laatste De 
nl|rol van deze speler was het oppikken van verloren ballen en eventueel te helpen met 
nl|dubbele mandekking Een andere innovatie was de snelle counteraanval vooral door lange ballen vanuit de 
nl|In de versie van Herrera in de jaren zestig werden de vier mandekkers zorgvuldig de 
nl|opdracht gegeven de dekking van één aanvaller op zich te nemen Achter die vier verdedigers 
nl|speelde dan nog de libero die iedere afvallende bal moest oppikken Door de nadruk te 
nl|leggen op de defensie heeft Italië door de jaren veel verdedigers van wereldklasse voortgebracht zoals 
nl|Franco Baresi Paolo Maldini en Fabio Cannavaro Herrera claimde kort voor zijn dood echter nog 
nl|dat mensen zijn tactiek te verdedigend onthouden hebben Hij zei dat 'het probleem is dat 
nl|mensen die mij gekopieerd hebben dat verkeerd gedaan hebben Ze zijn vergeten de aanvallende aspecten 
nl|van mijn catenaccio over te nemen Ik had Picchi als libero ja maar ik had 
nl|ook Facchetti de eerste vleugelverdediger die zoveel scoorde als een Het catenaccio van Herrera was 
nl|echter verre van perfect zo liet Rinus Michels zien met zijn totaalvoetbal Bij het totaalvoetbal 
nl|heeft niemand een vaste positie; van alle spelers wordt verwacht de taken van een aanvaller 
nl|middenvelder en verdediger te kunnen vervullen Mandekking wordt daarom onmogelijk geacht tegen een dergelijk systeem

nl|twee doelpunten Johan Cruijff en het Algemeen Dagblad sprak over 'de vernietiging van het defensieve 
nl|In herhaalde Ajax dit kunstje om van het defensieve AC Milan te winnen in de 
nl|strijd om de Europese Supercup De ploeg van coach Cesare Maldini ging met liefst de 
nl|boot in het Amsterdamse Olympisch Stadion Als er gespeeld wordt met pure zonale verdediging dan 
nl|heeft iedere verdediger en middenvelder een bepaald deel van het veld dat het zelf moet 
nl|dekken Bij catenaccio was er echter sprake van mandekking; soms werd zelfs dubbele dekking toegepast 
nl|bij erg sterke Tegen het totaalvoetbal was dat echter onbegonnen werk gezien het feit dat 
nl|aanvallers hielpen verdedigen en verdedigers aanvallen wat het erg moeilijk dekken maakt Enzo Bearzot bondscoach 
nl|van Italië kwam echter met een oplossing Zona Mista Italiaans voor 'gemengde zone' Het was 
nl|een combinatie van de kracht van zonale dekking en de sterke punten van het Bij 
nl|Zona Mista ook bekend als Il gioco all'Italiana 'Het spel in Italiaanse stijl' is er 
nl|sprake van een defensie van vier verdedigers Een libero speelt vrij voor de doelman en 
nl|ondersteunt de centrale verdedigers bij hun taken Er speelt een vleugelverdediger meestal aan de linkerkant 
nl|die er offensief speelt en vaak bijna een middenvelder is Op het middenveld spelen drie 
nl|spelers in het midden namelijk een verdedigende middenvelder een centrale middenvelder en een spelmaker Aan 
nl|de kant waar de back niet speelt meestal dus de rechterkant is nog een flankspeler 
nl|die soms als extra aanvaller speelt Voorin staan twee spitsen Een centrale spits staat bij 
nl|het strafschopgebied om voor doelpunten te zorgen en een schaduwspits speelt om hem heen om 
nl|in de ruimtes te spelen Tijdens het einde van de jaren zeventig en het begin 
nl|van de jaren tachtig was Zona Mista de dominante tactiek in het Italiaanse voetbal en 
nl|tijdens het WK beleefde het Italiaans voetbalelftal grote successen door de wereldtitel binnen te Gaetano 
nl|Scirea speelde als libero Fulvio Collovati en Claudio Gentile als centrale verdedigers Antonio Cabrini als 
nl|vleugelverdediger Gabriele Oriali als verdedigende middenvelder Marco Tardelli als centrale middenvelder Giancarlo Antognoni als spelmaker 
nl|en Paolo Rossi als diepe spits Zona Mista verloor echter aan populariteit en steeds minder 
nl|werd de tactiek toegepast Volgens de Italiaanse journalist Ludovico Maradei 'speelden alle teams met hetzelfde 
nl|systeem' en 'was het erg voorspelbaar doordat iedereen mandekking Hamburger SV toonde deze uitspraken aan 
nl|door in in de Europacup Ifinale met een zeer verdedigende tactiek met te winnen van 
nl|Juventus dat grotendeels bestond uit de spelers die met Italië wereldkampioen waren In het hedendaagse 
nl|voetbal is vrijwel geen sprake meer van het 'echte' catenaccio Bij de meeste tactieken worden 
nl|mandekking en het gebruik van de libero niet meer toegepast Een zeer defensieve speelstijl wordt 
nl|vaak nog wel catenaccio genoemd maar meestal wordt er wel met een ander systeem gespeeld 
nl|wat afgeleid is van het catenaccio Tegenwoordig wordt er steeds meer met zonale verdediging gespeeld 
nl|in plaats van De libero is bijna in zijn totaliteit verdwenen Teams gebruiken liever een 
nl|extra speler op een andere plaats in het Er wordt veel gedacht dat catenaccio veel

nl|verdreven De Tamiltijgers streden voor de onafhankelijke staat Tamil Eelam De Singalezen zijn hoofdzakelijk boeddhisten 
nl|en de Tamils hindoes Sri Lanka voorheen bekend als Ceylon is een republiek op het 
nl|Indiase subcontinent Het land heeft iets meer dan miljoen inwoners op een oppervlakte van km² 
nl|keer Nederland Hoofdstad van Sri Lanka is de stad Sri Jayewardenapura Kotte Het merendeel procent 
nl|van de bevolking is Singalees Een minderheid procent van de bevolking is Tamil Bijna elke 
nl|bevolkingsgroep in Sri Lanka komt oorspronkelijk uit India De Singalezen vestigden zich op het eiland 
nl|in de eeuw vChr Later in de eeuw vChr stichtten de Singalezen een koninkrijk op 
nl|het eiland De steden Anuradhapura vChr tot nChr en Polonnaruwa tot nChr waren het centrum 
nl|van bloeiende boeddhistische koninkrijken Ook de Tamils emigreerden vanuit India naar Sri Lanka Zij stichtten 
nl|in de eeuw een koninkrijk in het noorden van het land Het gebied in het 
nl|noorden en oosten van Sri Lanka werd het ‘thuisland’ van de Tamils Nog steeds wonen 
nl|de Tamils vooral in dat gebied In sloot de VOC een bondgenootschap met het Singalese 
nl|koninkrijk van Kandy In bezetten de Engelsen Sri Lanka om te voorkomen dat het eiland 
nl|in Franse handen viel – Nederland was toen een vazalstaat van het napoleontische Frankrijk De 
nl|Engelsen stichtten plantages in het binnenland om koffie thee en kokos te verbouwen Hiervoor werden 
nl|veel arbeidskrachten uit India geïmporteerd Dit waren voornamelijk Indiase Tamils Om hun gezag te handhaven 
nl|probeerden de Engelsen bevolkingsgroepen tegen elkaar uit te spelen De geïmporteerde Tamils waren betrekkelijk eenvoudig 
nl|onder de duim te houden Om aan de Singalese meerderheid een tegenwicht te bieden zorgden 
nl|de Engelsen voor goed onderwijs aan de Tamilminderheid in het noorden van het land De 
nl|Tamilminderheid kreeg zo een dominante positie in het bestuur ten opzichte van de Singalese meerderheid 
nl|Ook hadden zij vaak betere banen dan de Singalezen Zelfs in het zuiden en westen 
nl|van het land – het gebied waar voornamelijk Singalezen wonen – kregen de Tamils de 
nl|beste posities toebedeeld De Tamils voerden ook de executiebevelen van de Britten uit die uitgevaardigd 
nl|waren tegen Singalese verzetsstrijders Dit wakkerde het nationalisme onder de Singalezen aan Ze begonnen hun 
nl|gezamenlijke geschiedenis te benadrukken Als gevolg van het nationalisme begonnen de Singalezen zich steeds agressiever 
nl|af te zetten tegen de koloniale overheerser en de bevolkingsgroep die profiteerde van de Engelse 
nl|kolonisatie de Tamils Na de onafhankelijkheid in werkten de bevolkingsgroepen aanvankelijk samen Alleen de Indiase 
nl|Tamils die op de plantages werkten vielen hierbuiten De regering ontnam de Indiase Tamils hun 
nl|burgerrechten ze mochten bijvoorbeeld niet stemmen Dit beperkte de invloed van de Tamils in de 
nl|politiek In jaren werden wetten aangenomen die Sri Lanka ‘singaliseerden’ Engels werd vervangen door Singalees 
nl|en de goede baantjes bij de overheid werden vanaf nu ingenomen door Singalezen Deze ontwikkeling 
nl|ging steeds verder en de Tamils ontwikkelden een sterk natiebewustzijn De roep om een eigen 
nl|staat werd steeds luider In werden The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Tamiltijgers een gewapende 
nl|groepering opgericht De Tamiltijgers pleegden terreuraanslagen op Singalese doelwitten De regering nam een antiterrorismewet aan 
nl|en arresteerde veel Tamiljeugd De terreur van Tamiltijgers was mede veroorzaakt door terreur van Singalezen 
nl|jegens de Tamils Toen de Tamils nog goede posities hadden in de regering werden veel 
nl|Tamils vermoord door Singalezen en werden velen verdreven naar het noorden In werd de politieke 
nl|partij van de Tamils – de TULF – verbannen uit het parlement waardoor de Tamils 
nl|niet meer vertegenwoordigd waren Dit leidde tot onlusten en burgerlijke ongehoorzaamheid in de gebieden waar 
nl|de Tamils de meerderheid hadden vooral in het noorden De regering reageerde hierop door meer 
nl|Singalese soldaten naar het noorden te zenden In pleegden militante Tamils een aanslag op regeringssoldaten 
nl|In Jaffna een stad in het noorden van Sri Lanka werden soldaten gedood Dit veroorzaakte 
nl|een golf van geweld in het hele land Tamils en hun bezittingen werden aangevallen door 
nl|Singalese burgers Deze burgers hadden zich verenigd in kleine gewelddadige groepen die Tamils vermoordden en 
nl|huizen van Tamils platbrandden Na drie dagen slaagde de regering erin de rust te laten 
nl|wederkeren In die drie dagen waren duizenden Tamils op de vlucht geslagen naar India en 
nl|werden er nog eens duizenden gedood de regering spreekt over de Tamils over doden In 
nl|de jaren tachtig en negentig ontstond een patroon de Tamiltijgers pleegden zelfmoordaanslagen die leidden tot 
nl|vergeldingsacties van de regeringstroepen In het begin van de oorlog waren er verschillende groepen van 
nl|militante Tamils vaak jongeren maar de Tamiltijgers zien zichzelf als de enige vertegenwoordiger van de 
nl|Tamils De kleinere groepen werden gedwongen zich aan te sluiten bij de Tamiltijgers en zij 
nl|die niet loyaal waren aan de Tamiltijgers werden vermoord Deze groepering groeide uit tot een 
nl|internationaal netwerk Later in de jaren werden sommige discriminerende maatregelen weer teruggedraaid door andere regeringen 
nl|Zo werd Tamil een officiële taal Toch ging de oorlog verder met vele doden tot 
nl|gevolg Na Noorse bemiddeling werd in een staakthetvuren gesloten Daarna werd er onderhandeld maar de 
nl|Tamiltijgers staakten de onderhandelingen in omdat de regering volgens hen niet genoeg goede wil toonde 
nl|Toen in december een tsunami Sri Lanka overspoelde en veel gebouwen en infrastructuur vernielde laaiden 
nl|de spanningen weer op De hulp die Sri Lanka kreeg mocht van de Tamiltijgers niet 
nl|naar hun gebied waardoor de Tamils het zonder hulp moesten stellen In laaide het geweld 
nl|weer op in korte tijd vielen er doden bij gevechten tussen de Tamiltijgers en regeringstroepen 
nl|Daarom werden weer onderhandelingen gevoerd in Genève maar die leverden niets op Hierna werd de 
nl|oorlog hervat en kwam een einde aan het staakthetvuren van De Tamiltijgers bezetten toen een 
nl|sluis waardoor burgers zonder water kwamen te zitten Als vergelding bombardeerde de luchtmacht een wapenopslagplaats 
nl|onder een school in Tamilgebied waarbij naast een groot aantal Tamiltijgers ook een aantal meisjes 
nl|omkwam De onstabiele situatie remt de economische ontwikkeling van Sri Lanka enorm Mensenrechtenorganisaties signaleren dat 
nl|mensenrechten door beide partijen geschonden worden Noorse bemiddelingspogingen hebben niet veel effect gehad In laaide 
nl|het conflict weer op waarbij het regeringsleger al snel terreinwinst wist te boeken De stad 
nl|Kilinochchi dat als de officieuze hoofdstad van de Tamiltijgers gold werd veroverd op januari en 
nl|op mei gaven de restanten van de Tamiltroepen zich gewonnen Beschuldigingen van oorlogsmisdrijven vooral in

nl|King's Quest Quest for the Crown ook gekend als King's Quest is het allereerste grafische

nl|King's Quest Het verhaal en ontwerp komt van Roberta Williams Het spel werd uitgebracht door 
nl|Sierra Entertainment De subtitel Quest for the Crown werd pas toegevoegd toen het spel in 
nl|werd heruitgebracht Deze subtitel wordt echter in het spel zelf nergens vermeld Enkel op de 
nl|doos waarin het spel zat stond King's Quest Quest for the Crown In de originele 
nl|versie uit is het verhaal eenvoudig Het koninkrijk Daventry heeft te kampen met rampen Het 
nl|zijn er moeilijke tijden om te leven Koning Edward roept zijn koenste ridder bij hem 
nl|Sir Grahame Grahame dient op zoek te gaan naar drie legendarische schatten welke de problemen 
nl|zullen oplossen Indien hij slaagt zal hij koning In latere spellen en heruitgaves werd de 
nl|naam Grahame aangepast naar Graham Toen het spel in werd uitgebracht voor IBM PC en 
nl|Apple II werd het achterliggend verhaal uitgebreid Het koninkrijk Daventry heeft zware problemen nadat drie 
nl|magische voorwerpen werden verwijderd uit het kasteel In een magische spiegel die de toekomst voorspelt 
nl|zagen de koning en zijn vrouw ooit een visioen over een jonge man die koning 
nl|wordt Ze gingen er verkeerdelijk van uit dat deze man hun toekomstige zoon is Omdat 
nl|ze zich door de spiegel bedrogen voelden schonken ze deze aan een tovenaar Jaren later 
nl|wanneer de koningin ziek is komt een dwerg met de belofte dat de wortels van 
nl|een bepaalde plant haar zullen redden De dwerg wil de plant gaan zoeken maar heeft 
nl|daarvoor 'het beschermende schild van Daventry' nodig De koning gaat akkoord maar de dwerg loog 
nl|en keert niet meer terug De gezondheidstoestand van de koningin gaat achteruit en ze sterft 
nl|uiteindelijk De koning gaat op zoek naar een nieuwe vrouw Hij redt de mooie prinses 
nl|Dahlia uit Cumberland en trouwt met haar Zij blijkt echter een lelijke heks te zijn 
nl|en gaat er na het huwelijk met de 'de onuitputtelijke gouden schatkist' van Daventry vandoor 
nl|Het kasteel en het land Daventry geraken in verval Koning Edward roept zijn koenste ridder 
nl|tot zich Sir Graham Graham moet op zoek gaan naar de drie verloren voorwerpen Omdat 
nl|de koning geen navolging heeft zal Graham zijn opvolger worden indien hij slaagt in de 
nl|King's Quest is het eerste grafische avonturenspel met interactieve fictie Oorspronkelijk toonden avonturenspellen enkel tekst 
nl|op het scherm De speler diende via het toetsenbord commando's in te geven Later werden 
nl|de avonturenspellen uitgebreid met statische tekeningen Pas met King's Quest werd het concept van animatie 
nl|toegevoegd en kon de speler het hoofdpersonage daadwerkelijk besturen en acties laten uitvoeren Commando's dienden 
nl|nog wel manueel ingegeven te worden via het toetsenbord Verder was King's Quest ook een 
nl|van de eerste spellen dat op PC PCjr en Tandy een kleurenpalet gebruikte Computers met 
nl|een CGAkaart konden ook kleuren tonen op voorwaarde men een kleurenmonitor of televisie gebruikte met 
nl|behulp van een composietvideokabel Indien men enkel RGB gebruikte toonde het spel kleuren Het spel 
nl|gebruikte vectorafbeelding omdat voorgerendeerde bitmaps te veel plaats innemen op diskettes Bij een vectorafbeelding wordt 
nl|elk scherm realtime opgebouwd en ingekleurd Pas vanaf King's Quest V wordt gebruikgemaakt van bitmaps 
nl|King's Quest werd uitgebracht in ter promotie van de nieuwe IBM PCjr Het was het 
nl|eerste spel dat werd gemaakt met AGI Sierra's interne ontwikkeltool King's Quest was een ambitieus 
nl|risocovol en duur project voor zijn tijd De meeste computerspellen werden door één programmeur geschreven 
nl|in assembly over een periode van enkele weken Wanneer men besliste om het spel uit 
nl|te brengen voor een ander soort van computer diende men het spel opnieuw te herschrijven 
nl|in de assembly van dat computermodel Bij King's Quest waren er voltijdse programmeurs die maanden 
nl|nodig hadden om het spel te maken Geschat wordt dat de ontwikkeling van het spel 
nl|Amerikaanse dollar bedroeg Net omdat het spel animatie bevatte was het zo goed als onmogelijk 
nl|om enkel gebruik te maken van assembly Vandaar dat Sierra een interne script engine maakte 
nl|AGI Adventure Game Interpreter Een bijkomend voordeel van AGI was dat men het spel nu 
nl|eenvoudig kon porten naar andere systemen Omdat de IBM PCjr flopte viel de verkoop van 
nl|King's Quest tegen Dankzij de AGIinterface kon Sierra het spel op zeer korte termijn ook 
nl|uitbrengen voor Tandy IBM PC en Apple II Dit werd wel een groot succes In 
nl|werd het spel herontwikkeld met de AGI enginge en opnieuw uitgebracht voor DOS waarbij gebruik 
nl|werd gemaakt van bootdiskettes Tezelfdertijd verscheen het spel voor het eerst op Amiga Atari ST 
nl|en daarna op Sega Master System De AGI was sterk verbeterd Deze engine maakte geen 
nl|gebruik meer van een tekstparser maar wel van point and click De nieuwe bootversie van 
nl|DOS mist enkele geluidseffecten Ook werd met de AGI gebruikgemaakt van offscreen buffering Met AGI 
nl|zag de gebruiker hoe het scherm werd opgebouwd en werden objecten een voor een opgebouwd 
nl|en ingekleurd Hierdoor zag de speler al voorwerpen die uiteindelijk verborgen kwamen te liggen Ter 
nl|illustratie als achter een boom bijvoorbeeld een hark verborgen ligt dan zag de speler in 
nl|AGI hoe de hark werd opgebouwd en hoe er vervolgens een boom voor de hark 
nl|werd getekend De speler wist dus dat er een hark achter de boom lag In 
nl|AGI wordt eerst het ganse speelveld in het geheugen van de computer getekend en pas 
nl|dan getoond De speler weet dus niet meer dat er achter die boom een hark 
nl|ligt Verrassend genoeg kwam King's Quest niet uit op Commodore terwijl dit een van de 
nl|meest gebruikte computers was Volgens Roberta Williams was dit een bewuste keuze omdat de resolutie 
nl|van de Commodore te beperkt was en men niet tot het gewenste detail kon gaan 
nl|Verder had de commodore slechts kilobyte aan geheugen wat te weinig zou zijn om de 
nl|AGIengine te kunnen gebruiken King's Quest I Quest for the Crown werd in opnieuw geprogrammeerd 
nl|ditmaal met SCIontwikkeltool Deze interpreter werd ook gebruikt voor onder andere King's Quest IV Hoewel 
nl|de heruitgave nog steeds kleuren had werd de resolutie van de tekeningen verdubbeld en werd 
nl|support toegevoegd voor geluidskaarten zoals AdLib en Sound Blaster Het spelverloop is geen exacte kopie 
nl|van het originele Het verhaal werd sterk uitgebreid en er werden cutscenes toegevoegd In tegenstelling 
nl|tot het originele spel moet de speler nu eerst op zoek gaan naar de 'onuitputtelijke 
nl|gouden schatkist' en de 'magische spiegel van de toekomst' Pas dan kan hij op zoek 
nl|gaan naar 'het beschermdende schild van Daventry' Veel personages kregen een beduidend grotere rol en 
nl|tekst en ook nieuwe personages werden geïntroduceerd Sommige puzzels kregen een alternatieve oplossing of werden 
nl|verwijderd De locatie van sommige voorwerpen werd ook aangepast Zo vindt de speler in het 
nl|originele spel de keien aan de rivier In de remake liggen deze aan het meer 
nl|Andere locaties werden gerestyled zo hebben de bergen geen trappen meer maar wel een opgaande 
nl|weg Ook de soundtrack werd gedeeltelijk aangepast De remake werd echter slecht onthaald door critici 
nl|en werd vergeleken met het inkleuren van klassieke zwartwitfilms Omwille van deze redenen werden de 
nl|andere spellen uit de reeks niet heruitgebracht De versie voor Sega Master System verscheen in 
nl|en gebruikt zijn eigen gameengine Het spel kwam rechtstreeks uit als point and click aangezien 
nl|deze spelconsole standaard geen toestenbord heeft om de commando's in te typen Het spel werd 
nl|gedistribueerd door Parker Brothers Verder wijkt ook dit spel af van het originele uit er 
nl|zijn extra plaatsen waar de speler kan sterven savegames zijn beveiligd met een wachtwoord Wel 
nl|kan men in dit spel de drie schatten in een willekeurige volgorde zoeken In bracht 
nl|AGD Interactive een officieuze remake uit van het spel uit De resolutie werd opgedreven naar 
nl|VGA en er werd gebruikgemaakt van een Ook de tekstinterpreter werd vervangen door een interface 
nl|zoals gebruikt in King's Quest V Verder kwam het spel uit op cdrom en werd 
nl|het volledig ingesproken De stem van King Graham werd ingesproken door Josh Mandel die ook
